One of the more common methods is to manually create a <code>[&lt;VirtualHost&gt;](http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.0/mod/core.html#virtualhost)</code> record for each virtual host. While using this method is fine, it can end you up with a huge configuration file that is difficult to manage.</p> <p>Because all of my virtual hosts are sub-directories of my web server’s base directory, I prefer to dynamically allocate the virtual host directory based on the host name. For example, I want wildlyinaccurate.localhost to point to <code>/var/www/wildlyinaccurate</code>. This can be achieved by modifying the <code>.htaccess</code> file of your web server’s base directory:</p> <a href="/dynamic-virtual-hosts-using-htaccess/">(Read more)</a> </article> <article class="post-summary"> <span class="post-summary__meta">May 17, 2011</span> <h3> <a class="post-summary__link" href="/codeigniter-2doctrine-2-installation/">CodeIgniter 2/Doctrine 2 Installation</a> </h3> <p></p><p>If you want a quick way of getting Doctrine 2 working with CodeIgniter 2, you can download a pre-configured installation <a href="https://github.com/wildlyinaccurate/CodeIgniter-2-with-Doctrine-2">from my GitHub repository</a>.

The codebase is clean, the <a href="http://codeigniter.com/user_guide/">documentation</a> is fantastic, and it’s regularly updated.
