            </h3>

            <p><p>I’ve long been considering switching to a different keyboard layout. I tend to type with mostly my forefinger and middle finger, only using my ring and pinky fingers occasionally to stretch out to the modifier keys. Despite this, I still manage to type at around 120WPM on a staggered QWERTY keyboard.</p>

<p>Thinking back, I probably started teaching myself to type at a reasonable speed around age 10. I’m now in my mid-twenties. My typing technique (or lack thereof) never really bothered me, but 15 years of typing with poor technique has started to take its toll. Recently I’ve started experiencing hand fatigue, and I’m beginning to see early signs of RSI. So I figure now is the perfect time to make some changes to the way I type.</p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>Git is currently the most widely used version control system in the world, mostly thanks to GitHub. By that measure, I’d argue that it’s also the most misunderstood version control system in the world.</p>

<p>This statement probably doesn’t ring true straight away because on the surface, Git is pretty simple. It’s really easy to pick up if you’ve come from another VCS like Subversion or Mercurial. It’s even relatively easy to pick up if you’ve never used a VCS before. Everybody understands adding, committing, pushing and pulling; but this is about as far as Git’s simplicity goes. Past this point, Git is shrouded by fear, uncertainty and doubt.</p>

            </h3>

            <p><p><em>This is the first post in a series on JavaScript. In this post I’m going to explain how JavaScript’s prototype chain works, and how you can use it to achieve inheritance.</em></p>

<p>First, it’s important to understand that while JavaScript is an object-oriented language, it is prototype-based and does not implement a traditional class system. Keep in mind that when I mention a <em>class</em> in this post, I am simply referring to JavaScript objects and the prototype chain – more on this in a bit.</p>

<p>Almost everything in JavaScript is an object, which you can think of as sort of like associative arrays - objects contain named properties which can be accessed with <code>obj.propName</code> or <code>obj['propName']</code>. Each object has an internal property called <em>prototype</em>, which links to another object. The prototype object has a prototype object of its own, and so on – this is referred to as the <em>prototype chain</em>. If you follow an object’s prototype chain, you will eventually reach the core <code>Object</code> prototype whose prototype is <code>null</code>, signalling the end of the chain.</p>

<p>So what is the prototype chain used for? When you request a property which the object does not contain, JavaScript will look down the prototype chain until it either finds the requested property, or until it reaches the end of the chain. This behaviour is what allows us to create “classes”, and implement inheritance.</p>

                <a class="post-summary__link" href="/what-makes-code-readable">Defining readable code</a>
            </h3>

            <p><p>Code readability is something that I often bring up during code reviews, but I often have trouble explaining <em>why</em> I find a piece of code to be easy or difficult to read.</p>

<p>When you ask programmers how to make code easier to read, many of them will mention things like coding standards, descriptive naming, and decomposition. These things actually aid in making code easier to <em>comprehend</em> rather than easier to <em>read</em>. For me, <em>readability</em> is at a lower level, somewhere between legibility and comprehension.</p>

<p> </p>

<div>
    

    

    

    
    <div>
        Legibility - Readability - Comprehension
    </div>
    
</div>

<p>At the lowest level is legibility. This is how easily individual characters can be distinguished from each other, and can usually be boiled down to the choice of font, as well as the foreground &amp; background colours.</p>

<p>At the highest level is comprehension, which is the ease in which a block of code can be fully understood. Decomposition, naming conventions and comments are just a few of the many ways to improve comprehension.</p>

<p>Readability sits between these two. This level is a little harder to define, but I believe it comes down to two main factors: <strong>structure</strong> and <strong>line density</strong>.</p>

                <a class="post-summary__link" href="/http-status-as-a-service">HTTP status as a service</a>
            </h3>

            <p><p>Using Node.js* you can run a simple “HTTP status as a service” server. This can be useful for quickly checking whether your application handles various status codes.</p>

<div><pre><code>var http = require('http');

http.createServer(function (request, response) {
  var status = request.url.substr(1);

  if ( ! http.STATUS_CODES[status]) {
    status = '404';
  }

  response.writeHead(status, { 'Content-Type': 'text/plain' });
  response.end(http.STATUS_CODES[status]);
}).listen(process.env.PORT || 5000);</code></pre></div>

<p>This will create a server on port 5000, or any port that you specify in the <code>PORT</code> environment variable. It will respond to <code>/{CODE}</code> and return the HTTP status that corresponds to <code>{CODE}</code>. Here’s a couple of examples:</p>

<div><pre><code>$ curl -i http://127.0.0.1:5000/500
HTTP/1.1 500 Internal Server Error
Content-Type: text/plain
Date: Mon, 30 Sep 2013 14:10:10 GMT
Connection: keep-alive
Transfer-Encoding: chunked

Internal Server Error%
</code></pre></div>
<div><pre><code>$ curl -i http://127.0.0.1:5000/404
HTTP/1.1 404 Not Found
Content-Type: text/plain
Date: Mon, 30 Sep 2013 14:10:32 GMT
Connection: keep-alive
Transfer-Encoding: chunked

Not Found%
</code></pre></div>

<p>This is a really simple example, and could easily be extended to let you specify a <code>Location</code> header value for 30X responses.</p>

            <p><p>I noticed that the Internet Sharing functionality didn’t work on my Macbook Air (running OSX 10.8 - Mountain Lion). This is because the Air’s DNS server (BIND) isn’t configured correctly.</p>

            </h3>

            <p><p>One of my favourite Ruby Rogues episodes (<a href="http://rubyrogues.com/what-makes-beautiful-code/"><em>What Makes Beautiful Code</em></a>) has a short section where the Rogues talk about the concept of <em>dishonest code</em>. David Brady wrote a <a href="http://chalain.livejournal.com/39332.html">really good piece</a> on this, which I highly recommend reading.</p>

<p>What I want to talk about is a more specific variant of dishonest code: dishonest comments.</p>

<p>Take this code, for example:</p>

<div><pre><code>$('a').click(function(e) {
    e.stopPropagation();
    e.preventDefault();
});</code></pre></div>

<p>If you’re not familiar with JavaScript events, <code>e.stopPropagation()</code> will stop this event from bubbling up to other event handlers. Now, what if somebody decides that the event <em>should</em> bubble up? They might do something like this:</p>

<div><pre><code>--- a/example.js
+++ b/example.js
@@ -1,4 +1,4 @@
 $('a').click(function(e) {
+    // Let the event bubble up to the next handler
-    e.stopPropagation();
     e.preventDefault();
 });</code></pre></div>

<p>This is pretty common practice; a developer will leave a comment so that the next person understands why the <code>e.stopPropagation()</code> is gone.</p>

            </h3>

            <p><p>Quite often I’ve accidentally typed “git” twice. Usually this is fine, and Git just does something like this:</p>

<div><pre><code>$ git git diff
git: 'git' is not a git command. See 'git --help'.

Did you mean this?
    init
</code></pre></div>

<p>But I recently turned on Git’s autocorrect feature, to see what it was like (<code>git config --global help.autocorrect 1</code>). The results were… <em>interesting</em>:</p>

<div><pre><code>$ git git diff
WARNING: You called a Git command named 'git', which does not exist.
Continuing under the assumption that you meant 'init' in **0.1 seconds** automatically...
fatal: internal error: work tree has already been set
Current worktree: /nfs/personaldev/vagrant/mobileweb-v2
New worktree: /nfs/personaldev/vagrant/mobileweb-v2/diff
</code></pre></div>

<p>This is really bizarre behaviour. The fact that it wants to autocorrect it to <code>git init</code> is <em>sort-of</em> okay. But rather than giving me the option to confirm that this is what I want, Git gives me a whole <strong>0.1 seconds</strong> to hit Ctrl+C before it automatically runs the command for me.</p>

<p>Thankfully, <code>git init</code> isn’t a very destructive command. I was lucky that the only side effect of this was that Git created a new directory called <code>diff</code>. I can’t help but wonder what would’ve happened if Git decided to autocorrect to a more destructive command like <code>reset</code>, <code>checkout</code>, or <code>gc</code>.</p>

<p>The lesson here? Don’t use Git’s autocorrect. It really sucks.</p>

<p>Update: m_bright pointed out that the value of <code>help.autocorrect</code> is actually how many tenths of a second Git will wait before automatically executing the command. So something like <code>git config --global help.autocorrect 10</code> would give you 1 second before the command is executed, which is probably slow enough to let you cancel any mistakes, and quick enough to still be useful.</p>

            <p><p>When you <code>apt-get install php5</code> on a Debian/Ubuntu server, you’ll notice that APT will automatically install a bunch of <code>apache2</code> packages as well. This can be pretty annoying if you’re planning on using another web server (or no web server at all).</p>

<p>If you take a look at the package dependencies (<a href="http://packages.debian.org/wheezy/php5">Debian</a>/<a href="http://packages.ubuntu.com/quantal/php5">Ubuntu</a>) you’ll see why this happens - <code>php5</code> needs one of either <code>libapache2-mod-php5</code>, <code>libapache2-mod-php5filter</code>, <code>php5-cgi</code>, or <code>php5-fpm</code>. APT doesn’t care which package it installs; it just picks the first package that satisfies the dependency, which is why you get the <code>apache2</code> packages.</p>

<p>You can get around this by installing one of the other dependencies <em>before</em> <code>php5</code>. For example, <code>apt-get install php5-fpm php5</code> or <code>apt-get install php5-cgi php5</code>.</p>

            <p><p>Sometimes you’ll want to use your local SSH keys on your Vagrant boxes, so that you don’t have to manage password-less keys for each box. This can be done with SSH agent forwarding, which is <a href="http://www.unixwiz.net/techtips/ssh-agent-forwarding.html">explained in great detail on Unixwiz.net</a>.</p>

<p>Setting this up is fairly straightforward. On the host machine, you need to add the following to <code>~/.ssh/config</code> (which you should create if it doesn’t exist):</p>

<div><pre><code>host your.domain.com
    ForwardAgent yes
</code></pre></div>

<p>You need to replace <code>your.domain.com</code> with either the domain or the IP address of your Vagrant box. You can wildcard this with <code>host *</code>, but this is a <em>really</em> bad idea because it lets every server you SSH to access your keys.</p>

<p>Once you’ve done that, just run <code>ssh-add</code> to ensure you ensure your identities are added to the SSH agent.</p>

<p>Now, add the following to the config block in your Vagrantfile:</p>

<div><pre><code>config.ssh.forward_agent = true</code></pre></div>

<p>That’s all it takes. You can make sure it worked by comparing the output of <code>ssh-add -L</code> on both the host machine and the guest box.</p>

            <p><p>This evening I wanted to start hacking on a <a href="https://github.com/wildlyinaccurate/wildly-minimalistic-wordpress-theme">project of mine</a>, which is a simple WordPress theme. My main development machine was being used by somebody else, so I decided to boot up my old Sony Vaio running Ubuntu. <em>It’ll be simple</em>, I thought. <em>I’ve just got to clone the repo, run <code>npm install</code>, <code>bower install</code>, and <code>grunt build</code>, and I’ll be good to go</em>. I was wrong.</p>

<p>First, the version of npm installed on the laptop is apparently so out-of-date that it can’t run the install. So I let it update itself (and all the other packages I have installed - why not?) with <code>sudo npm -g update</code>. Being a Sunday night, my broadband connection is running spectacularly slow, so the update process takes about 10 minutes at 40kB/s. But hey, at least now I can run <code>npm install</code>, right?</p>

<p>Nope. Now npm is throwing some errors with unhelpful messages, but that’s fine, I’ll just trawl through the error log. 5 minutes later, I figure out that ~/tmp belongs to root (probably from running <code>npm update</code> as root). Ok, fine, I’ll change the permissions and try again. This time <code>npm install</code> works! But of course, my connection is so horribly slow and grunt has so many dependencies that the install process takes <strong>over 15 minutes</strong>.</p>
