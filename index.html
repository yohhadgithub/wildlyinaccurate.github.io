At the time, this was cutting edge. They were able to build pages that worked on practically any browser without compromising the experience for users on modern browsers. To quote directly from the Responsive News blog:</p> <p>This technique is still in use today, and is an integral part of the front-end strategy for all modern BBC News pages. In 2012 it allowed the team to provide a fast and lightweight experience for users on low-end devices. 7 HTTP requests totalling 21KB was all it took to load the core experience of the BBC News front page. All users benefited from this fast initial page load, with modern browsers progressively enhancing the rest of the page after the content was loaded.</p> <p>It has been over 4 years since the BBC News core experience was first built, and a lot has changed since then. Today, the core experience consists of 91 HTTP requests totalling 685KB – over 32x heavier than the original core experience. With JavaScript disabled this can be reduced to 137KB – still over 6x heavier.</p> <p>The BBC News team is aware of their website’s shortcomings. Back in May 2015 I conducted a huge performance review which I’ve spoken about extensively both <a href="http://slides.com/wildlyinaccurate/bbc-news-performance-review">internally</a> and <a href="http://slides.com/wildlyinaccurate/bbc-news-performance">externally</a> (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nE4LTRfcr94">video</a>). A <em>lot</em> of work has been done over the last year, and many of the issues mentioned in those slides have already been addressed. Despite this, the elephant in the room is still the core experience.</p> <p>That’s why when BBC News ran an internal hack day (where people can form teams to work on whatever they like) I took the opportunity to totally redefine the BBC News core experience.</p> <a href="/redefining-the-bcc-news-core-experience/">(Read more)</a> </article> <article class="post-summary"> <span class="post-summary__meta">Mar 28, 2016</span> <h3> <a class="post-summary__link" href="/how-can-we-fix-open-source-culture/">How can we fix open source culture?</a> </h3> <p></p><p>The recent kerfuffle around the <a href="http://blog.npmjs.org/post/141577284765/kik-left-pad-and-npm">NPM #unpublishgate</a> and the <a href="https://medium.com/@boennemann/your-just-considered-harmful-679db7366b95">Greenkeeper bot impersonation</a> has got me thinking about the open source community and its culture.</p> <p>Sometimes the open source community feels like a wonderful, cooperative, welcoming place.

The soft Cherry MX Brown switches make it my favourites for long periods of typing. Even so, I rarely use it any more. At the time of writing, this model is still available <a href="http://www.daskeyboard.com/model-s-ultimate/">on the Das Keyboard website</a>.</p> <div> <div> Das Keyboard Model S Ultimate </div> </div> <h3>CODE Keyboard</h3> <p>I was really excited when Jeff Atwood <a href="http://blog.codinghorror.com/the-code-keyboard/">announced the CODE keyboard</a>. I already knew that I wanted my next keyboard to be compact and have backlit keys, so the CODE seemed to come at just the right time. Not long after buying the CODE, I purchased some <a href="https://www.massdrop.com/buy/keycool-rainbow-keycaps?mode=guest_open">Keycool rainbow keycaps</a> so brighten things up.</p> <p>The CODE has Cherry MX Clear switches, which makes for a much firmer keyboard than the Das. I find the clears preferable for short bursts of typing, but over long periods they tire my hands out.</p> <div> <div> CODE keyboard with Keycool rainbow keycaps </div> </div> <h3>ErgoDox</h3> <p>As I’ve mentioned in <a href="/transitioning-to-a-new-keyboard-layout/">a previous post</a>, I decided that I wanted a split-hand keyboard. After much searching, I settled on buying an ErgoDox kit <a href="https://www.massdrop.com/buy/ergodox?mode=guest_open">from Massdrop</a>. This was a really fun project and involved spending plenty of time at the London Hackspace soldering station. The ErgoDox is by far the most comfortable keyboard I’ve used – I like it so much I’ve even placed an order for <a href="https://www.massdrop.com/buy/infinity-ergodox?mode=guest_open">the next generation ErgoDox</a>.</p> <p>My ErgoDox has Cherry MX Clear switches. Somehow the clears on the ErgoDox feel much softer than on the CODE, so I’m able to enjoy the feeling of firm keys without the fatigue I experience with the CODE.</p> <div> <div> ErgoDox keyboard </div> </div> <a href="/accidental-keyboard-enthusiasm/">(Read more)</a> </article> <article class="post-summary"> <span class="post-summary__meta">Jul 27, 2015</span> <h3> <a class="post-summary__link" href="/functional-programming-resources/">Functional Programming Resources</a> </h3> <p>This post contains a collection of resources for learning about functional programming.

It’s even relatively easy to pick up if you’ve never used a VCS before. Everybody understands adding, committing, pushing and pulling; but this is about as far as Git’s simplicity goes.

In this post I’m going to explain how JavaScript’s prototype chain works, and how you can use it to achieve inheritance.</em></p> <p>First, it’s important to understand that while JavaScript is an object-oriented language, it is prototype-based and does not implement a traditional class system. Keep in mind that when I mention a <em>class</em> in this post, I am simply referring to JavaScript objects and the prototype chain – more on this in a bit.</p> <p>Almost everything in JavaScript is an object, which you can think of as sort of like associative arrays - objects contain named properties which can be accessed with <code>obj.propName</code> or <code>obj['propName']</code>. Each object has an internal property called <em>prototype</em>, which links to another object. The prototype object has a prototype object of its own, and so on – this is referred to as the <em>prototype chain</em>. If you follow an object’s prototype chain, you will eventually reach the core <code>Object</code> prototype whose prototype is <code>null</code>, signalling the end of the chain.</p> <p>So what is the prototype chain used for? When you request a property which the object does not contain, JavaScript will look down the prototype chain until it either finds the requested property, or until it reaches the end of the chain. This behaviour is what allows us to create “classes”, and implement inheritance.</p> <a href="/understanding-javascript-inheritance-and-the-prototype-chain/">(Read more)</a> </article> <article class="post-summary"> <span class="post-summary__meta">Mar 10, 2014</span> <h3> <a class="post-summary__link" href="/what-makes-code-readable/">Defining readable code</a> </h3> <p></p><p>Code readability is something that I often bring up during code reviews, but I often have trouble explaining <em>why</em> I find a piece of code to be easy or difficult to read.</p> <p>When you ask programmers how to make code easier to read, many of them will mention things like coding standards, descriptive naming, and decomposition. These things actually aid in making code easier to <em>comprehend</em> rather than easier to <em>read</em>. For me, <em>readability</em> is at a lower level, somewhere between legibility and comprehension.</p> <p> </p> <div> <div> Legibility - Readability - Comprehension </div> </div> <p>At the lowest level is legibility. This is how easily individual characters can be distinguished from each other, and can usually be boiled down to the choice of font, as well as the foreground &amp; background colours.</p> <p>At the highest level is comprehension, which is the ease in which a block of code can be fully understood. Decomposition, naming conventions and comments are just a few of the many ways to improve comprehension.</p> <p>Readability sits between these two. This level is a little harder to define, but I believe it comes down to two main factors: <strong>structure</strong> and <strong>line density</strong>.</p> <a href="/what-makes-code-readable/">(Read more)</a> </article> <article class="post-summary"> <span class="post-summary__meta">Sep 30, 2013</span> <h3> <a class="post-summary__link" href="/http-status-as-a-service/">HTTP status as a service</a> </h3> <p></p><p>Using Node.js* you can run a simple “HTTP status as a service” server.
