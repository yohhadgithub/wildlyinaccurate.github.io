            </h3>

            <p><p>I’ve long been considering switching to a different keyboard layout. I tend to type with mostly my forefinger and middle finger, only using my ring and pinky fingers occasionally to stretch out to the modifier keys. Despite this, I still manage to type at around 120WPM on a staggered QWERTY keyboard.</p>

<p>Thinking back, I probably started teaching myself to type at a reasonable speed around age 10. I’m now in my mid-twenties. My typing technique (or lack thereof) never really bothered me, but 15 years of typing with poor technique has started to take its toll. Recently I’ve started experiencing hand fatigue, and I’m beginning to see early signs of RSI. So I figure now is the perfect time to make some changes to the way I type.</p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>Git is currently the most widely used version control system in the world, mostly thanks to GitHub. By that measure, I’d argue that it’s also the most misunderstood version control system in the world.</p>

<p>This statement probably doesn’t ring true straight away because on the surface, Git is pretty simple. It’s really easy to pick up if you’ve come from another VCS like Subversion or Mercurial. It’s even relatively easy to pick up if you’ve never used a VCS before. Everybody understands adding, committing, pushing and pulling; but this is about as far as Git’s simplicity goes. Past this point, Git is shrouded by fear, uncertainty and doubt.</p>

            </h3>

            <p><p><em>This is the first post in a series on JavaScript. In this post I’m going to explain how JavaScript’s prototype chain works, and how you can use it to achieve inheritance.</em></p>

<p>First, it’s important to understand that while JavaScript is an object-oriented language, it is prototype-based and does not implement a traditional class system. Keep in mind that when I mention a <em>class</em> in this post, I am simply referring to JavaScript objects and the prototype chain – more on this in a bit.</p>

<p>Almost everything in JavaScript is an object, which you can think of as sort of like associative arrays - objects contain named properties which can be accessed with <code>obj.propName</code> or <code>obj['propName']</code>. Each object has an internal property called <em>prototype</em>, which links to another object. The prototype object has a prototype object of its own, and so on – this is referred to as the <em>prototype chain</em>. If you follow an object’s prototype chain, you will eventually reach the core <code>Object</code> prototype whose prototype is <code>null</code>, signalling the end of the chain.</p>

<p>So what is the prototype chain used for? When you request a property which the object does not contain, JavaScript will look down the prototype chain until it either finds the requested property, or until it reaches the end of the chain. This behaviour is what allows us to create “classes”, and implement inheritance.</p>

            </h3>

            <p><p>Code readability is something that I often bring up during code reviews, but I often have trouble explaining <em>why</em> I find a piece of code to be easy or difficult to read.</p>

<p>When you ask programmers how to make code easier to read, many of them will mention things like coding standards, descriptive naming, and decomposition. These things actually aid in making code easier to <em>comprehend</em> rather than easier to <em>read</em>. For me, _readability _is at a lower level, somewhere between legibility and comprehension.</p>

<p> </p>

  

<p>At the lowest level is legibility. This is how easily individual characters can be distinguished from each other, and can usually be boiled down to the choice of font, as well as the foreground &amp; background colours.</p>

<p>At the highest level is comprehension, which is the ease in which a block of code can be fully understood. Decomposition, naming conventions and comments are just a few of the many ways to improve comprehension.</p>

<p>Readability sits between these two. This level is a little harder to define, but I believe it comes down to two main factors: <strong>structure</strong> and <strong>line density</strong>.</p>

                <a class="post-summary__link" href="/http-status-as-a-service">HTTP status as a service</a>
            </h3>

            <p><p>Using Node.js* you can run a simple “HTTP status as a service” server. This can be useful for quickly checking whether your application handles various status codes.</p>

<pre><code>var http = require('http');

http.createServer(function (request, response) {
  var status = request.url.substr(1);

  if ( ! http.STATUS_CODES[status]) {
    status = '404';
  }

  response.writeHead(status, { 'Content-Type': 'text/plain' });
  response.end(http.STATUS_CODES[status]);
}).listen(process.env.PORT || 5000);
</code></pre>

<p>This will create a server on port 5000, or any port that you specify in the <code>PORT</code> environment variable. It will respond to <code>/{CODE}</code> and return the HTTP status that corresponds to <code>{CODE}</code>. Here’s a couple of examples:</p>

<pre><code>$ curl -i http://127.0.0.1:5000/500
HTTP/1.1 500 Internal Server Error
Content-Type: text/plain
Date: Mon, 30 Sep 2013 14:10:10 GMT
Connection: keep-alive
Transfer-Encoding: chunked

Internal Server Error%
</code></pre>
<pre><code>$ curl -i http://127.0.0.1:5000/404
HTTP/1.1 404 Not Found
Content-Type: text/plain
Date: Mon, 30 Sep 2013 14:10:32 GMT
Connection: keep-alive
Transfer-Encoding: chunked

Not Found%
</code></pre>

<p>This is a really simple example, and could easily be extended to let you specify a <code>Location</code> header value for 30X responses.</p>

            <p><p>I noticed that the Internet Sharing functionality didn’t work on my Macbook Air (running OSX 10.8 - Mountain Lion). This is because the Air’s DNS server (BIND) isn’t configured correctly.</p>

<p>to</p>

<pre><code>forward only;

<p>Then turn Internet Sharing off and on again.</p>

<p>The annoying thing is that OSX seems to restore the BIND config the next time you turn Internet Sharing off, so you need to remember to change it each time.</p>

            </h3>

            <p><p>One of my favourite Ruby Rogues episodes (<a><em>What Makes Beautiful Code</em></a>) has a short section where the Rogues talk about the concept of <em>dishonest code</em>. David Brady wrote a <a>really good piece</a> on this, which I highly recommend reading.</p>

<p>What I want to talk about is a more specific variant of dishonest code: dishonest comments.</p>

<p>Take this code, for example:</p>

<pre><code>$('a').click(function(e) {
    e.stopPropagation();
    e.preventDefault();
});
</code></pre>

<p>If you’re not familiar with JavaScript events, <code>e.stopPropagation()</code> will stop this event from bubbling up to other event handlers. Now, what if somebody decides that the event <em>should</em> bubble up? They might do something like this:</p>

<pre><code>--- a/example.js
+++ b/example.js
@@ -1,4 +1,4 @@
 $('a').click(function(e) {
+    // Let the event bubble up to the next handler
-    e.stopPropagation();
     e.preventDefault();
 });
</code></pre>

<p>This is pretty common practice; a developer will leave a comment so that the next person understands why the <code>e.stopPropagation()</code> is gone.</p>

            </h3>

            <p><p>Quite often I’ve accidentally typed “git” twice. Usually this is fine, and Git just does something like this:</p>

<pre><code>$ git git diff
git: 'git' is not a git command. See 'git --help'.

Did you mean this?
    init
</code></pre>

<p>But I recently turned on Git’s autocorrect feature, to see what it was like (<code>git config --global help.autocorrect 1</code>). The results were… <em>interesting</em>:</p>

<pre><code>$ git git diff
WARNING: You called a Git command named 'git', which does not exist.
Continuing under the assumption that you meant 'init' in **0.1 seconds** automatically...
fatal: internal error: work tree has already been set
Current worktree: /nfs/personaldev/vagrant/mobileweb-v2
New worktree: /nfs/personaldev/vagrant/mobileweb-v2/diff
</code></pre>

<p>This is really bizarre behaviour. The fact that it wants to autocorrect it to <code>git init</code> is <em>sort-of</em> okay. But rather than giving me the option to confirm that this is what I want, Git gives me a whole <strong>0.1 seconds</strong> to hit Ctrl+C before it automatically runs the command for me.</p>

<p>Thankfully, <code>git init</code> isn’t a very destructive command. I was lucky that the only side effect of this was that Git created a new directory called <code>diff</code>. I can’t help but wonder what would’ve happened if Git decided to autocorrect to a more destructive command like <code>reset</code>, <code>checkout</code>, or <code>gc</code>.</p>

<p>The lesson here? Don’t use Git’s autocorrect. It really sucks.</p>

<p>Update: m_bright pointed out that the value of <code>help.autocorrect</code> is actually how many tenths of a second Git will wait before automatically executing the command. So something like <code>git config --global help.autocorrect 10</code> would give you 1 second before the command is executed, which is probably slow enough to let you cancel any mistakes, and quick enough to still be useful.</p>

            <p><p>When you <code>apt-get install php5</code> on a Debian/Ubuntu server, you’ll notice that APT will automatically install a bunch of <code>apache2</code> packages as well. This can be pretty annoying if you’re planning on using another web server (or no web server at all).</p>

<p>If you take a look at the package dependencies (<a>Debian</a>/<a>Ubuntu</a>) you’ll see why this happens - <code>php5</code> needs one of either <code>libapache2-mod-php5</code>, <code>libapache2-mod-php5filter</code>, <code>php5-cgi</code>, or <code>php5-fpm</code>. APT doesn’t care which package it installs; it just picks the first package that satisfies the dependency, which is why you get the <code>apache2</code> packages.</p>

<p>You can get around this by installing one of the other dependencies <em>before</em> <code>php5</code>. For example, <code>apt-get install php5-fpm php5</code> or <code>apt-get install php5-cgi php5</code>.</p>

            <p><p>Sometimes you’ll want to use your local SSH keys on your Vagrant boxes, so that you don’t have to manage password-less keys for each box. This can be done with SSH agent forwarding, which is <a>explained in great detail on Unixwiz.net</a>.</p>

<p>Setting this up is fairly straightforward. On the host machine, you need to add the following to <code>~/.ssh/config</code> (which you should create if it doesn’t exist):</p>

<pre><code>host your.domain.com
    ForwardAgent yes
</code></pre>

<p>You need to replace <code>your.domain.com</code> with either the domain or the IP address of your Vagrant box. You can wildcard this with <code>host *</code>, but this is a <em>really</em> bad idea because it lets every server you SSH to access your keys.</p>

<p>Once you’ve done that, just run <code>ssh-add</code> to ensure you ensure your identities are added to the SSH agent.</p>

<p>Now, add the following to the config block in your Vagrantfile:</p>

<pre><code>config.ssh.forward_agent = true
</code></pre>

<p>That’s all it takes. You can make sure it worked by comparing the output of <code>ssh-add -L</code> on both the host machine and the guest box.</p>

            <p><p>This evening I wanted to start hacking on a <a>project of mine</a>, which is a simple WordPress theme. My main development machine was being used by somebody else, so I decided to boot up my old Sony Vaio running Ubuntu. <em>It’ll be simple</em>, I thought. <em>I’ve just got to clone the repo, run <code>npm install</code>, <code>bower install</code>, and <code>grunt build</code>, and I’ll be good to go</em>. I was wrong.</p>

<p>First, the version of npm installed on the laptop is apparently so out-of-date that it can’t run the install. So I let it update itself (and all the other packages I have installed - why not?) with <code>sudo npm -g update</code>. Being a Sunday night, my broadband connection is running spectacularly slow, so the update process takes about 10 minutes at 40kB/s. But hey, at least now I can run <code>npm install</code>, right?</p>

<p>Nope. Now npm is throwing some errors with unhelpful messages, but that’s fine, I’ll just trawl through the error log. 5 minutes later, I figure out that ~/tmp belongs to root (probably from running <code>npm update</code> as root). Ok, fine, I’ll change the permissions and try again. This time <code>npm install</code> works! But of course, my connection is so horribly slow and grunt has so many dependencies that the install process takes <strong>over 15 minutes</strong>.</p>

<p>My current setup is Nginx and PHP-FPM, with WP Super Cache. The cache is saved to the filesystem, allowing Nginx to serve static files (which it is <a>very good at</a>) without needing to pass any requests to PHP. This setup has worked very well, so I’ll be using it as a baseline.</p>

<p>To use Memcached, every request needs to be passed to PHP. My gut feeling was that this would be slower than serving static files with Nginx due to the overhead of spinning up a PHP process for each request.</p>

<h2>Benchmarks</h2>

<p>To find out which of the two setups was faster, I measured the following metrics using <a>WebPagetest</a> and <a>Blitz</a> :</p>

            </h3>

            <p><p>After upgrading php-fpm, my PHP-based sites were returning “502 Bad Gateway” errors. This can happen when the php5-fpm package reconfigures itself to listen on a different socket. Here’s how you can solve it.</p>

<p>Check to make sure that php-fpm is running with <code>ps aux | grep php</code> - if you can’t see any php-fpm processes in the output, then you may need to re-install php-fpm. If php-fpm is running okay, then skip this first step.</p>

<pre><code>sudo apt-get remove php5 php5-cgi php5-fpm
sudo apt-get install php5 php5-cgi php5-fpm
</code></pre>

<p>The thing to notice here is that the order in which you install the packages is important. In the past I have found that installing them in the wrong order causes the packages to be configured incorrectly.</p>

<p>Next, get php-fpm to listen on the correct host/port. In <code>/etc/php5/fpm/pool.d/www.conf</code> change the <code>listen</code> value to match the <code>fastcgi_pass</code> location in your Nginx configuration. For example, I changed mine from:</p>

<pre><code>listen = /var/run/php5-fpm.sock
</code></pre>

<p>To:</p>

<pre><code>listen = 127.0.0.1:9000
</code></pre>

<p>If you are configuring php-fpm to listen on a Unix socket, you should also check that the socket file has the correct owner and permissions. While I wouldn’t recommend it, you can simply give read-write permissions to all with <code>sudo chmod go+rw /var/run/php5-fpm.sock</code>.</p>

<p>Restart php-fpm with <code>sudo service php5-fpm restart</code> and everything should work normally again.</p>

            <p><p>In the early hours of 4 September 2010, I was sound asleep in my house on Mount Pleasant hill in Christchurch, New Zealand. At 4:35am I was woken by a deep rumbling sound. Seconds later, the floor and walls began to shake as my house was rocked back and forth on its foundations. I scrambled out of bed and hid in a doorway until the shaking stopped. After checking that my family was okay, I went upstairs and stepped onto the balcony to look out over Christchurch. The city was silent save for a few car alarms, and it was in this relative quiet that I came to understand the significance of this event. I didn’t realise it then, but that earthquake would become a catalyst for change in my life.</p>

            </h3>

            <p><p>Bcrypt is a Blowfish-based hashing algorithm which is commonly used for password hashing because of its potentially expensive key setup phase. A Bcrypt hash has the following structure:</p>

<pre><code>$2a$(2 chars work)$(22 chars salt)(31 chars hash)
</code></pre>

<p>The reason that the key setup phase can be potentially expensive is because it is run <code>2&lt;sup&gt;work&lt;/sup&gt;</code> times. As password hashing is usually associated with common tasks like logging a user into a system, it’s important to find the right balance between security and performance. Using a high work factor makes it incredibly difficult to execute a brute-force attack, but can put unnecessary load on the system.</p>

<p>Using <a>Marco Arment’s PHP Bcrypt class</a>, I performed some benchmarks to determine how long it takes to hash a string with various work factors:</p>

            <p><p>It’s really easy to set up automatic MySQL backups using <code>mysqldump</code>. First, you need to set up a user with <code>SELECT</code> and <code>LOCK TABLES</code> privileges. In this example the user doesn’t have a password.</p>

GRANT SELECT, LOCK TABLES ON *.* TO 'autobackup'@'localhost';

</code></pre>

<p>Don’t forget to change <strong>dbname</strong> to the name of the database that you want to backup. And that’s it - you’re done! This cron job will create a backup of your database and save it to <code>/var/backups</code> with a filename based on the current date, e.g. <code>/var/backups/**dbname**-20120503.sql.gz</code></p>

            </h3>

            <p><p>MySQL has a <a>prefix limitation</a> of 767 bytes in InnoDB, and 1000 bytes in MyISAM. This has never been a problem for me, until I started using UTF-16 as the character set for one of my databases. UTF-16 can use up to 4 bytes per character which means that in an InnoDB table, you can’t have any keys longer than 191 characters. Take this <code>CREATE</code> statement for example:</p>

<pre><code>CREATE TABLE `user` (
  `id` int(11) NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
  `username` varchar(32) NOT NULL,
  `password` varchar(64) NOT NULL,
  `email` varchar(255) NOT NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY (`id`),
  UNIQUE KEY `UNIQ_8D93D649F85E0677` (`username`),
  UNIQUE KEY `UNIQ_8D93D649E7927C74` (`email`)
) ENGINE=InnoDB DEFAULT CHARSET=utf16 AUTO_INCREMENT=1 ;
</code></pre>

<p>This will fail with an error like <code>Specified key was too long; max key length is 767 bytes</code>, because the <code>UNIQUE INDEX</code> on the email field requires at least 1020 bytes (255 * 4).</p>

<p>Unfortunately there is no real solution to this. Your only options are to either reduce the size of the column, use a different character set (like UTF-8), or use a different engine (like MyISAM). In this case I switched the character set to UTF-8 which raised the maximum key length to 255 characters.</p>

            <p><p>I came across this recently while I was developing a module for PyroCMS. Some of the PyroCMS tables contain ENUM columns, which Doctrine doesn’t support. You would think that this wouldn’t be an issue since these tables are not mapped, but apparently when Doctrine builds the schema it includes all tables in the database - even if they are not mapped. This has been <a>reported as an issue</a>, but the Doctrine team has given it a low priority.</p>

<p>The symptom? When using the SchemaTool to create, update, or drop the schema; an exception is thrown:</p>

<pre><code>**Fatal error**: Uncaught exception 'Doctrine\DBAL\DBALException' with message 'Unknown database type enum requested, Doctrine\DBAL\Platforms\MySqlPlatform may not support it.'
</code></pre>

<p>Thankfully, the fix is very easy. There is even a <a>Doctrine Cookbook article</a> about it. All you have to do is register the ENUM type as a Doctrine varchar (string):</p>

<pre><code>/** @var $em \Doctrine\ORM\EntityManager */
$platform = $em-&gt;getConnection()-&gt;getDatabasePlatform();
$platform-&gt;registerDoctrineTypeMapping('enum', 'string');
</code></pre>

<p>This fix can be applied to any unsupported data type, for example SET (which is also used in PyroCMS):</p>

<pre><code>$platform-&gt;registerDoctrineTypeMapping('set', 'string');

<p>Each commit you make has your name and email address attached to it. Git will automatically configure these based on your username and hostname, but this information is usually not a good identifier. It is a good idea to set your real name and email address so that your commits can be identified easily.</p>

git config --global user.email you@yourdomain.com

<h2>Global ignore file</h2>

<p>Often there are files or directories that you want Git to ignore globally. These are probably created automatically by your IDE or operating system. Git’s <code>core.excludesfile</code> config allows you to write a global .gitignore so that you don’t have to fill local .gitignore files with clutter.</p>

            <p><p>It’s debatable whether or not it’s good practice to use short syntax in PHP. I personally prefer to use short syntax because it keeps my view files looking tidy.</p>

<p>The regular expression below will find all one-liner <code>print</code> and <code>echo</code> statements (e.g. <code>&lt;?php print $var; ?&gt;</code>) and convert them to <code>&lt;?=$var?&gt;</code> statements. It will not match statements containing closing brackets, for example when using ternary operators: <code>&lt;?=($foo == $bar) ? 'Foobar' : 'Foo'?&gt;</code></p>

<pre><code>Find:
&lt;\?php[\s]*(print|echo)[\s]*\(?([^&gt;\)]+?)\)?[\s]*;?[\s]*\?&gt;
</code></pre>
<pre><code>Replace:
&lt;?=$2?&gt;
</code></pre>

            <p><p>The <code>find</code> utility’s -exec flag makes it very easy to recursively perform operations on specific files or directories.</p>

<pre><code>find . -type d -exec chmod 755 {} \;
</code></pre>

<p>This command finds all directories (starting at ‘dot’ - the current directory) and sets their permissions to 755 (rwxr-xr-x).</p>

<pre><code>find . -type f -exec chmod 644 {} \;
</code></pre>

<p>Similarly, this command finds all files and sets their permissions to 644 (rw-r–r–).</p>

            </h3>

            <p><p>There are several ways to set up virtual hosts on your web server. One of the more common methods is to manually create a <code>[&lt;VirtualHost&gt;](http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.0/mod/core.html#virtualhost)</code> record for each virtual host. While using this method is fine, it can end you up with a huge configuration file that is difficult to manage.</p>

<p>Because all of my virtual hosts are sub-directories of my web server’s base directory, I prefer to dynamically allocate the virtual host directory based on the host name. For example, I want wildlyinaccurate.localhost to point to /var/www/wildlyinaccurate. This can be achieved by modifying the .htaccess file of your web server’s base directory:</p>

            <p><p>People who enjoy listening to more ‘traditional’ styles of music often believe that electronic music shouldn’t be called ‘real’ music. They believe that producing electronic music must be so easy, because after all, isn’t it just a few loops played over and over? This is one of the common misconceptions about electronic music production.</p>

<p>I have recently been working on a remix of a <a>Shapeshifter</a> song called Longest Day. To give you an idea of the music production process and how it is much more than looping a few sounds, I’m going to share with you some of the work that I’ve put into this remix.</p>

            <p><p>A word of warning: eAccelerator does not play well with Doctrine 2. This came to my attention today after I installed eAccelerator so that I could measure the performance gains (if any). As it turns out, one of eAccelerator’s “features” is to remove Docblocks from PHP scripts - probably to reduce compile times. Suddenly my application was throwing exceptions with the message “Class <em>X</em> is not a valid entity or mapped super class”.</p>

            <p><p>My latest CodeIgniter 2 project requires that I use query strings in some of my URLs. CodeIgniter 1 was notoriously difficult to work with when you enabled query strings, and unfortunately CodeIgniter 2 is no different. Whereas in CodeIgniter 1 you could change two configuration options to enable a combination of segment-based URLs and query strings, this same approach only makes matters worse in CodeIgniter 2.</p>
