I have regularly and loudly complained that <a href="/redefining-the-bcc-news-core-experience/">the BBC News website is unnecessarily slow</a>, so when I was given the opportunity to help rebuild one of the most visited pages of BBC News &#x2014;the front page&#x2014; I jumped at the chance.</p> <p>That was April 2016. Now, a whole year later, we&#x2019;re ready to begin a phased rollout of the new front page. Starting with a small percentage of users in the UK, we will gradually move everybody to the new front page over the course of several weeks. If you&#x2019;re eager to see it before the rollout is complete, it is available at <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/0">www.bbc.co.uk/news/0</a>.</p> <h2>Quick facts about the new front page</h2> <ul> <li>It is lighter and faster than the old one: <ul> <li>First meaningful paint happens up to <strong>50% sooner</strong> on mobile devices.</li> <li>Page enhancements like lazy-loaded images load <strong>150% faster</strong> on mobile, and <strong>70% faster</strong> on desktop.</li> <li>The total bytes downloaded is <strong>50% less</strong> on mobile and <strong>75% less</strong> on desktop.</li> <li>CPU busy time has been reduced by <strong>30%</strong> on mobile and by <strong>50%</strong> on desktop.</li> <li>Performance monitoring has been automated with <a href="https://speedcurve.com/">SpeedCurve</a> from the beginning of the project.</li> </ul> </li> <li>It is available over HTTPS, and we have plans to redirect insecure traffic to HTTPS in the not-so-distant future.</li> <li>The page is built from React components that are styled with the BBC&#x2019;s CSS framework, <a href="https://github.com/bbc/grandstand">Grandstand</a>.</li> <li>Each component is a horizontal &#x201C;slice&#x201D; of the page that fetches its own data. This makes it easy for us to reuse slices on any page.</li> <li>The React components are individually rendered by the BBC&#x2019;s React-component-as-an-API-endpoint service and assembled into a page by our <a href="/how-we-assemble-web-pages-at-bbc-news/">page-assembly-as-a-service system</a>.</li> <li>React is only used on the server. We do not load it in the browser.</li> <li>The development team consists of 5 developers and 1 tester, but we have collaborated with over 60 other developers and testers from all around the BBC to build this page.</li> </ul> <h2>What&#x2019;s next?</h2> <p>The version of the front page we&#x2019;re rolling out is an MVP, a <em>phase one</em>. We will be changing it considerably over the next several months. Here&#x2019;s an idea of what you can expect to see:</p> <a href="/introducing-a-faster-bbc-news-front-page/">(Read more)</a><p></p> </article> <article class="pb-3"> <span class="f-r c-gl">Feb 16, 2017</span> <h3> <a href="/web-development-technologies-to-adopt-in-2017/">Web development technologies to adopt in 2017</a> </h3> <p></p><p>I started 2016 feeling quite overwhelmed by the sheer number of new technologies that were being introduced. This year I feel like many of those technologies have matured, so I have collated a list of the ones that I think deserve your attention. My focus for the last couple of years has been on performance, so I&#x2019;ve made an effort to ensure that all of the technologies mentioned are either &#x201C;performance-friendly&#x201D; or are directly related to performance.</p> <h3>Preact &#x2014; <a href="https://preactjs.com/">preactjs.com</a></h3> <p>A fast 3kB alternative to React with the same ES6 API. For projects that use React&#x2019;s other APIs, <a href="https://github.com/developit/preact-compat">preact-compat</a> exists as a compatibility layer allowing Preact to be a complete drop-in replacement for React.</p> <p>As well as being smaller than React, Preact is also much faster. I measured the impact of migrating to Preact in three projects and saw a 3-4x reduction in JavaScript execution times in all of them .</p> <h3>Webpack &#x2014; <a href="https://webpack.js.org/">webpack.js.org</a></h3> <p>Bundle your scripts, images, styles, assets&#x2026; I was initially put off Webpack because I thought it did too much. With the help of <a href="https://github.com/petehunt/webpack-howto">Pete Hunt&#x2019;s webpack-howto</a> I realised that Webpack can be as simple or as complex as you want it to be.</p> <p>These days I recommend that people use Webpack even for trivial projects because it&#x2019;s easy to set up, the defaults are good, and it opens up a huge number of possibilities for optimising your application.</p> <h3>offline-plugin &#x2014; <a href="https://github.com/NekR/offline-plugin">github.com/NekR/offline-plugin</a></h3> <p>A highly-configurable Webpack plugin that provides an offline experience for your application using ServiceWorker, with AppCache as a fallback.</p> <p>If there&#x2019;s one thing on this list that you consider adopting, it should be this. The number of people around the world whose sole means of accessing the Internet on a mobile phone is <em>increasing</em>. We can improve their experience on the web immeasurably by utilising technologies like ServiceWorker &amp; AppCache, and this plugin is a ridiculously easy way to do that.</p> <h3>Tachyons &#x2014; <a href="http://tachyons.io/">tachyons.io</a></h3> <p>Functional CSS for humans. Tachyons is a mobile-first responsive CSS framework with a focus on accessibility. Its single-purpose class structure is scalable and practically removes the need to write any custom CSS.</p> <p>Tachyons has a relatively small footprint, and is extremely modular so you can easily include only what you need. It&#x2019;s a good, powerful alternative to heavier frameworks like Bootstrap or Foundation.</p> <h3>Lighthouse &#x2014; <a href="https://github.com/GoogleChrome/lighthouse">github.com/GoogleChrome/lighthouse</a></h3> <p>Built by some of the industry&#x2019;s foremost web performance evangelists, Lighthouse is an automated tool for analysing your web application&#x2019;s performance and providing insights on developer best practices.</p> <p>As well as using it as a once-in-a-while test, I also recommend running Lighthouse on a regular basis &#x2014; perhaps part of a daily build. Its insights are broad enough to cover a wide range of issues from accessibility to performance, but specific enough that any issues are easily actionable.</p> <a href="/web-development-technologies-to-adopt-in-2017/">(Read more)</a><p></p> </article> <article class="pb-3"> <span class="f-r c-gl">Feb 13, 2017</span> <h3> <a href="/how-we-assemble-web-pages-at-bbc-news/">How we assemble web pages at BBC News</a> </h3> <p></p><blockquote> <p>This post is about the Web Application Framework in use by some teams at the BBC. It is not strictly a framework in that it specifies the contracts between components, rather than providing concrete implementations of the components. For this reason, I prefer to think of it as the Web Application <em>Specification</em>.</p> </blockquote> <p></p><p>At the beginning of 2015, a group of developers and technical architects from around the BBC got together with the goal of designing a system for sharing web page components between teams. This came from an acceptance that most of the BBC&#x2019;s public-facing web products have a similar look &amp; feel, and a desire to improve efficiency through sharing rather than building similar things over and over again.</p> <div> <div> </div> </div> <p>In some organisations, technologies are standardised which makes sharing components between teams a trivial task. At the BBC, teams are free to use whichever technologies they like. This means that any component-sharing solution we come up with can&#x2019;t be tied to a template language, data structure, build system, or even a CSS preprocessor. This meant that building a component library like <a href="http://rizzo.lonelyplanet.com/styleguide/ui-components">Lonely Planet&#x2019;s Rizzo</a> or <a href="https://cloudflare.github.io/cf-ui/">CloudFlare&#x2019;s CFUI</a> was out of the picture. We also felt that something like <a href="http://registry.origami.ft.com/components">the FT&#x2019;s Origami</a> would require too much effort on the users of the components.</p> <p>We ended up going back to basics and designed a solution that is based on two premises:</p> <ol> <li>All of our web pages are built out of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.</li> <li>Most pages have three main parts: the head, which contains metadata and styling; the body, which contains content; and the part at the end of the body, which contains JavaScript.</li> </ol> <p>What we came up with is called the WAF, or <em>Web Application Framework</em>. It&#x2019;s a surprisingly simple framework, and is built on top of three core principles:</p> <ul> <li>Components as endpoints</li> <li>The envelope contract</li> <li>Page composition</li> </ul> <a href="/how-we-assemble-web-pages-at-bbc-news/">(Read more)</a><p></p> </article> <article class="pb-3"> <span class="f-r c-gl">Dec 26, 2016</span> <h3> <a href="/working-as-a-developer-at-bbc-news/">What it&apos;s like to work as a developer at BBC News</a> </h3> <p></p><p>The BBC is a pretty large organisation. Today it employs around 20,000 people (actually around 35,000 when you include part-time and fixed-term contract employees) across a huge number of divisions. The <a href="http://careerssearch.bbc.co.uk/">BBC Careers website</a> typically has over 100 vacancies posted on any given day. Before I joined the BBC, I found the sheer scale of it a bit intimidating. Usually I can get an idea of what it&#x2019;s like to work for a company by reading their job advertisements and their engineering blogs, but with the BBC I was almost completely clueless. In this post I hope to shed some light on what it&#x2019;s like to work as a developer or tester for BBC News.</p> <p>Just a small disclaimer first: from an engineering perspective, the BBC is not like most other companies &#x2014; it&#x2019;s more like dozens of smaller companies, each with their own engineering department, working towards a common goal. <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news">News</a>, <a href="http://www.bbc.com/sport">Sport</a>, <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes">Programmes</a>, <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer">iPlayer</a>, <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio">Radio</a>&#x2026; As digital products, these are all built mostly independently of each other. I work for BBC News, so a lot of what I&#x2019;ve written may not apply outside of BBC News.</p> <a href="/working-as-a-developer-at-bbc-news/">(Read more)</a><p></p> </article> <article class="pb-3"> <span class="f-r c-gl">Jul 22, 2016</span> <h3> <a href="/redefining-the-bcc-news-core-experience/">Redefining the BBC News core experience</a> </h3> <p></p><blockquote> <p><strong>TL;DR:</strong> Over the last 4 years, the BBC News core experience has been transformed from a speedy 21KB page into a slow &amp; bloated 685KB monster. This was in part due to a lack of performance monitoring and 4 years of feature creep, but also due to a lack of performance-oriented culture throughout the business.</p> <p>I created a lightweight prototype of the BBC News core experience which demonstrates that focusing on the content first and foremost can result in an extremely fast page. I want the BBC and other websites to rethink what the core experience means, and experiment with giving users the power to define their own experience.</p> </blockquote> <p></p><p>In the beginning of 2012 the BBC Responsive News team wrote about how they provide a &#x201C;core experience&#x201D; for users by default, and then progressively enhance the page if the browser <a href="http://responsivenews.co.uk/post/18948466399/cutting-the-mustard">cuts the mustard</a>. At the time, this was cutting edge. They were able to build pages that worked on practically any browser without compromising the experience for users on modern browsers. To quote directly from the Responsive News blog:</p> <blockquote> <p>The first tier of support we call the core experience. This works on everything. I&#x2019;ve seen it work on a Nokia E65, a Blackberry OS4, Kindle 1, a HTC Touch 2 running Win Mobile 6.5, a Samsung U900 Soul, a Commodore Vic20, my nan&#x2019;s slipper and a toaster just sellotaped to a TV. Likewise, GoogleBot, text-browsers like Lynx, folks that disable JavaScript and so on are all assured a good level of service.</p> </blockquote> <p>This technique is still in use today, and is an integral part of the front-end strategy for all modern BBC News pages. In 2012 it allowed the team to provide a fast and lightweight experience for users on low-end devices. 7 HTTP requests totalling 21KB was all it took to load the core experience of the BBC News front page. All users benefited from this fast initial page load, with modern browsers progressively enhancing the rest of the page after the content was loaded.</p> <p>It has been over 4 years since the BBC News core experience was first built, and a lot has changed since then. Today, the core experience consists of 91 HTTP requests totalling 685KB &#x2013; over 32x heavier than the original core experience. With JavaScript disabled this can be reduced to 137KB &#x2013; still over 6x heavier.</p> <p>The BBC News team is aware of their website&#x2019;s shortcomings. Back in May 2015 I conducted a huge performance review which I&#x2019;ve spoken about extensively both <a href="http://slides.com/wildlyinaccurate/bbc-news-performance-review">internally</a> and <a href="http://slides.com/wildlyinaccurate/bbc-news-performance">externally</a> (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nE4LTRfcr94">video</a>). A <em>lot</em> of work has been done over the last year, and many of the issues mentioned in those slides have already been addressed. Despite this, the elephant in the room is still the core experience.</p> <p>That&#x2019;s why when BBC News ran an internal hack day (where people can form teams to work on whatever they like) I took the opportunity to totally redefine the BBC News core experience.</p> <a href="/redefining-the-bcc-news-core-experience/">(Read more)</a><p></p> </article> <article class="pb-3"> <span class="f-r c-gl">Mar 28, 2016</span> <h3> <a href="/how-can-we-fix-open-source-culture/">How can we fix open source culture?</a> </h3> <p></p><p>The recent kerfuffle around the <a href="http://blog.npmjs.org/post/141577284765/kik-left-pad-and-npm">NPM #unpublishgate</a> and the <a href="https://medium.com/@boennemann/your-just-considered-harmful-679db7366b95">Greenkeeper bot impersonation</a> has got me thinking about the open source community and its culture.</p> <p>Sometimes the open source community feels like a wonderful, cooperative, welcoming place.

The soft Cherry MX Brown switches make it my favourites for long periods of typing. Even so, I rarely use it any more. At the time of writing, this model is still available <a href="http://www.daskeyboard.com/model-s-ultimate/">on the Das Keyboard website</a>.</p> <div> <div> </div> </div> <h3>CODE Keyboard</h3> <p>I was really excited when Jeff Atwood <a href="http://blog.codinghorror.com/the-code-keyboard/">announced the CODE keyboard</a>. I already knew that I wanted my next keyboard to be compact and have backlit keys, so the CODE seemed to come at just the right time. Not long after buying the CODE, I purchased some <a href="https://www.massdrop.com/buy/keycool-rainbow-keycaps?mode=guest_open">Keycool rainbow keycaps</a> so brighten things up.</p> <p>The CODE has Cherry MX Clear switches, which makes for a much firmer keyboard than the Das. I find the clears preferable for short bursts of typing, but over long periods they tire my hands out.</p> <div> <div> </div> </div> <h3>ErgoDox</h3> <p>As I&#x2019;ve mentioned in <a href="/transitioning-to-a-new-keyboard-layout/">a previous post</a>, I decided that I wanted a split-hand keyboard. After much searching, I settled on buying an ErgoDox kit <a href="https://www.massdrop.com/buy/ergodox?mode=guest_open">from Massdrop</a>. This was a really fun project and involved spending plenty of time at the London Hackspace soldering station. The ErgoDox is by far the most comfortable keyboard I&#x2019;ve used &#x2013; I like it so much I&#x2019;ve even placed an order for <a href="https://www.massdrop.com/buy/infinity-ergodox?mode=guest_open">the next generation ErgoDox</a>.</p> <p>My ErgoDox has Cherry MX Clear switches. Somehow the clears on the ErgoDox feel much softer than on the CODE, so I&#x2019;m able to enjoy the feeling of firm keys without the fatigue I experience with the CODE.</p> <div> <div> </div> </div> <a href="/accidental-keyboard-enthusiasm/">(Read more)</a><p></p> </article> <article class="pb-3"> <span class="f-r c-gl">Jul 27, 2015</span> <h3> <a href="/functional-programming-resources/">Functional Programming Resources</a> </h3> <p>This post contains a collection of resources for learning about functional programming.

configure: error: readline not found, so this package cannot be built
</code></pre> </div> <p>The problem is that Cabal is not aware of the location of the readline lib. My workaround is to specify the location of the lib whenever running these commands:</p> <div><pre><code>$ cabal install readline --extra-include-dirs=/usr/local/Cellar/readline/6.3.8/include/ \
                         --extra-lib-dirs=/usr/local/Cellar/readline/6.3.8/lib/ \
                         --configure-option=--with-readline-includes=/usr/local/Cellar/readline/6.3.8/include/readline \
                         --configure-option=--with-readline-libraries=/usr/local/Cellar/readline/6.3.8/lib/
</code></pre> </div> <p>Your paths may differ slightly if you have a different version of readline installed. You can check this with</p> <div><pre><code>$ ls /usr/local/Cellar/readline

I tend to type with mostly my forefinger and middle finger, only using my ring and pinky fingers occasionally to stretch out to the modifier keys. Despite this, I still manage to type at around 120WPM on a staggered QWERTY keyboard.</p> <p>Thinking back, I probably started teaching myself to type at a reasonable speed around age 10. I&#x2019;m now in my mid-twenties. My typing technique (or lack thereof) never really bothered me, but 15 years of typing with poor technique has started to take its toll. Recently I&#x2019;ve started experiencing hand fatigue, and I&#x2019;m beginning to see early signs of RSI. So I figure now is the perfect time to make some changes to the way I type.</p> <a href="/transitioning-to-a-new-keyboard-layout/">(Read more)</a><p></p> </article> <article class="pb-3"> <span class="f-r c-gl">Aug 2, 2014</span> <h3> <a href="/javascript-performance-variable-initialization/">JavaScript Performance: Variable Initialization</a> </h3> <p></p><p>Initializing variables properly in JavaScript can&#xA0;have significant performance benefits.&#xA0;This can be shown with a simple synthetic benchmark.</p> <h3>notype.js</h3> <div><pre><code>var x = null;

By that measure, I&#x2019;d argue that it&#x2019;s also the most misunderstood version control system in the world.</p> <p>This statement probably doesn&#x2019;t ring true straight away because on the surface, Git is pretty simple. It&#x2019;s really easy to pick up if you&#x2019;ve come from another VCS like Subversion or&#xA0;Mercurial. It&#x2019;s even&#xA0;relatively easy to pick up if you&#x2019;ve never used a VCS before.&#xA0;Everybody understands adding, committing, pushing and pulling; but this is about as far as Git&#x2019;s simplicity goes.

In this post I&#x2019;m going to explain how JavaScript&#x2019;s prototype chain works, and how you can use it to achieve inheritance.</em></p> <p>First, it&#x2019;s important to understand that while JavaScript is an object-oriented language, it is prototype-based and does not implement a traditional class system. Keep in mind that when I mention a&#xA0;<em>class</em> in this post, I am simply referring to JavaScript objects and the prototype chain &#x2013; more on this in a bit.</p> <p>Almost everything in JavaScript is an object, which you can think of&#xA0;as sort of like associative arrays - objects contain&#xA0;named properties which can be accessed with&#xA0;<code>obj.propName</code>&#xA0;or&#xA0;<code>obj[&apos;propName&apos;]</code>. Each object has an internal property called&#xA0;<em>prototype</em>, which links to another object. The prototype object has a prototype object of its own, and so on &#x2013;&#xA0;this is referred to as the&#xA0;<em>prototype chain</em>. If you follow an object&#x2019;s prototype chain, you will eventually reach the core&#xA0;<code>Object</code>&#xA0;prototype whose prototype is <code>null</code>, signalling the end of the chain.</p> <p>So what is the prototype chain used for? When you request a property which the object does not contain, JavaScript will look down the prototype chain until it either finds the requested property, or until it reaches the end of the chain. This behaviour is what allows us to create &#x201C;classes&#x201D;, and implement inheritance.</p> <a href="/understanding-javascript-inheritance-and-the-prototype-chain/">(Read more)</a><p></p> </article> <article class="pb-3"> <span class="f-r c-gl">Mar 10, 2014</span> <h3> <a href="/what-makes-code-readable/">Defining readable code</a> </h3> <p></p><p>Code readability is something that I often bring up during code reviews, but I often have trouble explaining <em>why</em> I find a piece of code to be easy or difficult to read.</p> <p>When you ask programmers how to make code easier to read, many of them will mention things like coding standards, descriptive naming, and decomposition. These things actually aid in making code easier to&#xA0;<em>comprehend</em>&#xA0;rather than easier to <em>read</em>.&#xA0;For me, <em>readability</em> is at a lower level,&#xA0;somewhere between legibility and comprehension.</p> <p>&#xA0;</p> <div> <div> </div> </div> <p>At the lowest level is legibility. This is how easily individual characters can be distinguished from each other, and can usually be boiled down to the choice of font, as well as the foreground &amp; background&#xA0;colours.</p> <p>At the highest level is comprehension, which is the ease in which a block of code can be fully understood. Decomposition, naming conventions and comments are just a few of the many ways to improve comprehension.</p> <p>Readability sits between these two. This level is a little harder to define, but I believe it comes down to two main factors: <strong>structure</strong> and <strong>line density</strong>.</p> <a href="/what-makes-code-readable/">(Read more)</a><p></p> </article> <div> <a class="btn p-3" href="/page2">&#x2190; Older Posts</a> </div> </section> <footer class="wrap mt-5 pt-4"> <ul class="ls-n f-r"> <li> <a href="https://github.com/wildlyinaccurate"> <span class="d-ib va-m w-4 h-4"> <svg viewbox="0 0 16 16"> <path fill="#828282" d="M7.999,0.431c-4.285,0-7.76,3.474-7.76,7.761 c0,3.428,2.223,6.337,5.307,7.363c0.388,0.071,0.53-0.168,0.53-0.374c0-0.184-0.007-0.672-0.01-1.32 c-2.159,0.469-2.614-1.04-2.614-1.04c-0.353-0.896-0.862-1.135-0.862-1.135c-0.705-0.481,0.053-0.472,0.053-0.472 c0.779,0.055,1.189,0.8,1.189,0.8c0.692,1.186,1.816,0.843,2.258,0.645c0.071-0.502,0.271-0.843,0.493-1.037 C4.86,11.425,3.049,10.76,3.049,7.786c0-0.847,0.302-1.54,0.799-2.082C3.768,5.507,3.501,4.718,3.924,3.65 c0,0,0.652-0.209,2.134,0.796C6.677,4.273,7.34,4.187,8,4.184c0.659,0.003,1.323,0.089,1.943,0.261 c1.482-1.004,2.132-0.796,2.132-0.796c0.423,1.068,0.157,1.857,0.077,2.054c0.497,0.542,0.798,1.235,0.798,2.082 c0,2.981-1.814,3.637-3.543,3.829c0.279,0.24,0.527,0.713,0.527,1.437c0,1.037-0.01,1.874-0.01,2.129 c0,0.208,0.14,0.449,0.534,0.373c3.081-1.028,5.302-3.935,5.302-7.362C15.76,3.906,12.285,0.431,7.999,0.431z"/> </svg> </span> <span>wildlyinaccurate</span> </a> </li> <li> <a href="https://twitter.com/joseph_wynn"> <span class="d-ib va-m w-4 h-4"> <svg viewbox="0 0 16 16"> <path fill="#828282" d="M15.969,3.058c-0.586,0.26-1.217,0.436-1.878,0.515c0.675-0.405,1.194-1.045,1.438-1.809
