    <p>Everybody wants to write “good code”, right? So why is it that nearly every time we pick up another developer’s work, our <a href="http://www.osnews.com/story/19266/WTFs_m">WTF-o-meter</a> goes crazy?</p>

<p>[&lt;div class="thumbnail"&gt;<br />
    <img class="thumbnail__image" alt="" src="/assets/wtfm.jpg" srcset="/assets/resized/wtfm-290x273.jpg 290w, /assets/resized/wtfm-315x297.jpg 315w,  /assets/wtfm.jpg 500w" /></p>

<p>&lt;/div&gt;</p>

<p>Everybody has a different idea of what “good code” is. Below are a few ways that I believe we can increase the quality of our code and reduce the number of WTFs our code generates.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Keep it simple; refactor overly-complex methods…</li>
  <li>…Or if refactoring isn’t feasible, document complex methods.</li>
  <li>Use <a href="http://xunitpatterns.com/Intent%20Revealing%20Name.html">descriptive variable and method names</a>.</li>
  <li>Follow code conventions.</li>
  <li>Don’t commit unfinished or broken code.</li>
</ul>

<p>Most of these are just common sense. The trouble is, we throw good coding practices – and common sense – out the window when we’re under pressure from things like slipping deadlines and scope creep. If you ever find this happening, just remember to** write your code as if the person who has to maintain it is a violent psychopath who knows where you live. **What would you rather: miss a deadline, or be hacked up into little pieces by an angry developer?</p>
