I tend to type with mostly my forefinger and middle finger, only using my ring and pinky fingers occasionally to stretch out to the modifier keys. Despite this, I still manage to type at around 120WPM on a staggered QWERTY keyboard.</p> <p>Thinking back, I probably started teaching myself to type at a reasonable speed around age 10. I&#x2019;m now in my mid-twenties. My typing technique (or lack thereof) never really bothered me, but 15 years of typing with poor technique has started to take its toll. Recently I&#x2019;ve started experiencing hand fatigue, and I&#x2019;m beginning to see early signs of RSI. So I figure now is the perfect time to make some changes to the way I type.<!--more--></p> <p>My first idea was to start using an ergonomic keyboard. The three keyboards which seemed to be most popular at the time were the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/hardware/en-gb/p/natural-ergonomic-keyboard-4000">Microsoft Natural Ergonomic</a>, the <a href="https://www.trulyergonomic.com/store/index.php">Truly Ergonomic</a>, and the soon-to-be-released <a href="http://matias.ca/ergopro/pc/">Matias Ergo Pro</a>. After trying some keyboards out, I realised that if I was going to do this properly, I would need a split-hand keyboard. This is mostly due to having quite broad shoulders, which means that when my hands are close together (like on a keyboard), my shoulders need to be bunched up in order for my hands to take the correct position. This can be quite uncomfortable, and I often find myself stretching and cracking my shoulders throughout the day.</p> <p>The Ergo Pro is the only one of the keyboards I was evaluating which had a split-hand design. Unfortunately it didn&#x2019;t take long for me to realise that despite the split-hand design, the Ergo Pro wasn&#x2019;t suitable either. A lot of the pain I get in my hands is due to over-stretching the ring and pinky fingers. The Ergo Pro still follows a fairly standard keyboard layout, which places the modifier keys in a position where you must reach your pinkies out in order to hit them.</p> <p>For a while, I was defeated.</p> <p>Then, I stumbled across the <a href="http://ergodox.org/">ErgoDox</a>. At a glance, this looked like the perfect keyboard for me. The split-hand design would relieve the tension from my shoulders, the thumb keys would reduce the need to stretch my pinkies to reach the modifier keys, and the non-staggered layout would help reduce the distance my fingers need to travel when changing rows. The fact that the keyboard is fully programmable with open-source firmware was what finally sold me.</p> <p>So I ordered myself an <a href="https://www.massdrop.com/buy/ergodox">ErgoDox kit from Massdrop</a>, and set around to building my keyboard.</p> <p>I built the keyboard in short bursts when I had spare time on the weekends. All up I probably invested about 10 hours over a period of two months. I made good use of the electronics station at <a href="https://london.hackspace.org.uk/">London Hackspace</a>, and learned a lot about soldering and about electronics in general. I&#x2019;m fairly confident that I could build another ErgoDox in a matter of hours.</p> <div class="my-4 ta-c thumbnail--bleed"> <img alt="The finished ErgoDox" src="/assets/ergodox-1024x551.jpg" srcset="/assets/resized/ergodox-1024x551-320x172.jpg 320w, /assets/resized/ergodox-1024x551-360x194.jpg 360w, /assets/resized/ergodox-1024x551-720x387.jpg 720w, /assets/resized/ergodox-1024x551-940x506.jpg 940w, /assets/ergodox-1024x551.jpg 1024w"> <div class="c-gl"> <small><i>The finished ErgoDox</i></small> </div> </div> <p>While the open-source firmware has <a href="https://github.com/wildlyinaccurate/ergodox-firmware/tree/master/src/keyboard/ergodox/layout">several layouts available</a>, Massdrop provides the binary firmware for a QWERTY layout to get you started. I didn&#x2019;t particularly feel like learning a completely new keyboard layout so I stuck with QWERTY, figuring that the layout of the ErgoDox would solve the fatigue problems I was having. I was wrong.</p> <p>Using the ErgoDox, I still felt like my fingers were moving just as much as on a regular keyboard. I used Patrick Gillespie&#x2019;s amazing <a href="http://patorjk.com/keyboard-layout-analyzer">Keyboard Layout Analyzer</a> to help me figure out what the problem was.</p> <div class="my-4 ta-c thumbnail--bleed"> <img alt="ErgoDox QWERTY Layout Heat Map" src="/assets/ergodox-qwerty-heatmap.png" srcset="/assets/resized/ergodox-qwerty-heatmap-320x122.png 320w, /assets/resized/ergodox-qwerty-heatmap-360x137.png 360w, /assets/resized/ergodox-qwerty-heatmap-720x274.png 720w, /assets/ergodox-qwerty-heatmap.png 929w"> <div class="c-gl"> <small><i>ErgoDox QWERTY Layout Heat Map</i></small> </div> </div> <p>The heat map above shows how the QWERTY layout requires you to constantly move your fingers between rows. For me, this was a major cause of discomfort. I decided that I needed to find a more efficient keyboard layout.</p> <p>Learning a new keyboard layout isn&#x2019;t something you can take lightly. There&#x2019;s a huge time investment required not only to learn the new layout, but to become proficient with it. For me, &#x201C;proficient&#x201D; means being able to type at least 100WPM &#x2013; hopefully even more. So finding the &#x201C;right&#x201D; layout was a fairly daunting task.</p> <p>After some experimenting and reading others&#x2019; thoughts, I finally settled on Colemak. There were a few reasons for this:</p> <ul> <li>The layout scores highly in the layout analyser when analysing code (which I spend more time typing than English).</li> <li>The heat map shows reduced movement between rows.</li> <li>Keys used for common keyboard shortcuts (Q, W, Z, X, C, V) remain unchanged.</li> <li>It felt the most &#x201C;natural&#x201D; compared to other popular layouts like Workman, Dvorak, and Programmer Dvorak.</li> </ul> <div class="my-4 ta-c thumbnail--bleed"> <img alt="The heat map for a Colemak layout on the ErgoDox" src="/assets/ergodox-colemak-heatmap1.png" srcset="/assets/resized/ergodox-colemak-heatmap1-320x122.png 320w, /assets/resized/ergodox-colemak-heatmap1-360x137.png 360w, /assets/resized/ergodox-colemak-heatmap1-720x274.png 720w, /assets/ergodox-colemak-heatmap1.png 929w"> <div class="c-gl"> <small><i>The heat map for a Colemak layout on the ErgoDox</i></small> </div> </div> <p>An article about <a href="http://jjt.io/2013/11/25/why-any-developer-should-check-out-the-ergodox-keyboard/">Jason Trill&#x2019;s experience with the ErgoDox</a> convinced me at the last minute to use a modified version of Colemak which puts the symbols on a separate layer around the home row, so you don&#x2019;t need to move your fingers to the top row to type symbols. In case you&#x2019;re wondering what I mean by a &#x201C;separate layer&#x201D;: layers on a keyboard are a way to have one key type different characters. You actually use layers all the time, even if you don&#x2019;t realise it. When you hold down the Shift key, you&#x2019;re activating another layer on your keyboard. When you hit the Caps Lock key, you&#x2019;re toggling that layer. Layers differ from key combinations (like Control + Alt + Delete) in that they&#x2019;re implemented in the keyboard&#x2019;s firmware rather than at the software level.</p> <div class="my-4 ta-c thumbnail--bleed"> <img alt="The &quot;symbolmod&quot; Colemak layout reduces finger movement even further" src="/assets/ergodox-colemak-symbolmod-heatmap.png" srcset="/assets/resized/ergodox-colemak-symbolmod-heatmap-320x122.png 320w, /assets/resized/ergodox-colemak-symbolmod-heatmap-360x137.png 360w, /assets/resized/ergodox-colemak-symbolmod-heatmap-720x274.png 720w, /assets/ergodox-colemak-symbolmod-heatmap.png 929w"> <div class="c-gl"> <small><i>The &quot;symbolmod&quot; Colemak layout reduces finger movement even further</i></small> </div> </div> <p>As you can probably tell from the heat map above, the &#x201C;Alt Gr&#x201D; key enables the symbol layer, allowing me to type common symbols without my fingers leaving the home row.</p> <h2 id="what-now">What now?</h2> <p>As of today, I&#x2019;ve only clocked up about an hour of typing with the new layout. I can only manage about 5WPM at the moment so it can be frustrating to use it for any more than a few minutes at a time.</p> <p>Rather than just trying to use the new layout for my day-to-day tasks, I&#x2019;ve come up with a plan to help me become productive with it first.</p> <h3 id="stage-1---touch-typing">Stage 1 - Touch Typing</h3> <p>Before I do anything else, I need to learn how to touch type with the new layout. At the moment I&#x2019;m relying on a printed guide, which I constantly refer to in order to find the keys I want. To learn how to touch type, I&#x2019;m going back to basics:</p> <div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy fox.
The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy fox.
The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy fox.
</code></pre> </div> <p>In theory, the more I use each key, the less I&#x2019;ll have to look at my guide.</p> <div class="my-4 ta-c thumbnail--bleed"> <img alt="The layout guide I&apos;m using to type at the moment" src="/assets/ergodox-layout-guide-1024x598.jpg" srcset="/assets/resized/ergodox-layout-guide-1024x598-320x187.jpg 320w, /assets/resized/ergodox-layout-guide-1024x598-360x210.jpg 360w, /assets/resized/ergodox-layout-guide-1024x598-720x420.jpg 720w, /assets/resized/ergodox-layout-guide-1024x598-940x549.jpg 940w, /assets/ergodox-layout-guide-1024x598.jpg 1024w"> <div class="c-gl"> <small><i>The layout guide I&apos;m using to type at the moment</i></small> </div> </div> <h3 id="stage-2---speed">Stage 2 - Speed</h3> <p>Once I&#x2019;m familiar enough with the layout, I&#x2019;ll need to get my speed up. There are plenty of tools available online which give you a list of randomly-chosen words to type, and report your speed at the end. I&#x2019;ve found that <a href="http://10fastfingers.com/typing-test/english">10FastFingers</a> is good enough for my needs. Hopefully doing this for a week or two will get me typing at least 60WPM again.</p> <h3 id="stage-3---programming">Stage 3 - Programming</h3> <p>I spend a lot of my waking life programming, so I&#x2019;ll need to become proficient with this new layout in a programming context. Up until this point I will have been typing mostly English words and some symbols on the new layout, so I&#x2019;ll need some practice programming before I&#x2019;m ready to use this layout for my day-to-day work.</p> <p>At the same time I will be continuing to use the typing speed tools and hopefully get closer to 100WPM.</p> <h3 id="stage-4---shortcuts">Stage 4 - Shortcuts</h3> <p>Once I&#x2019;ve reached my 100WPM goal and feel comfortable enough using the new layout in a programming context, I&#x2019;ll start using the new layout at work. The final step to fully converting to the new layout will be to re-learn all of the keyboard shortcuts which are currently part of my muscle memory on a QWERTY layout.</p> </article> <div class="wrap pt-4"> <small> <i>This post was written by <b>Joseph Wynn</b> on <b>31 October, 2014</b>, and last updated on <b>31 August, 2015</b>.
