I have regularly and loudly complained that <a href="/redefining-the-bcc-news-core-experience/">the BBC News website is unnecessarily slow</a>, so when I was given the opportunity to help rebuild one of the most visited pages of BBC News &#x2014;the front page&#x2014; I jumped at the chance.</p> <p>That was April 2016. Now, a whole year later, we&#x2019;re ready to begin a phased rollout of the new front page. Starting with a small percentage of users in the UK, we will gradually move everybody to the new front page over the course of several weeks. If you&#x2019;re eager to see it before the rollout is complete, it is available at <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/0">www.bbc.co.uk/news/0</a>.</p> <h2>Quick facts about the new front page</h2> <ul> <li>It is lighter and faster than the old one: <ul> <li>First meaningful paint happens up to <strong>50% sooner</strong> on mobile devices.</li> <li>Page enhancements like lazy-loaded images load <strong>150% faster</strong> on mobile, and <strong>70% faster</strong> on desktop.</li> <li>The total bytes downloaded is <strong>50% less</strong> on mobile and <strong>75% less</strong> on desktop.</li> <li>CPU busy time has been reduced by <strong>30%</strong> on mobile and by <strong>50%</strong> on desktop.</li> <li>Performance monitoring has been automated with <a href="https://speedcurve.com/">SpeedCurve</a> from the beginning of the project.</li> </ul> </li> <li>It is available over HTTPS, and we have plans to redirect insecure traffic to HTTPS in the not-so-distant future.</li> <li>The page is built from React components that are styled with the BBC&#x2019;s ITCSS framework, <a href="https://github.com/bbc/grandstand">Grandstand</a>.</li> <li>The React components are rendered by the BBC&#x2019;s React-component-as-an-API-endpoint service.</li> <li>React only used on the server. We do not load it in the browser.</li> <li>Each component is a self-contained horizontal &#x201C;slice&#x201D; of the page. Components fetch their own data and are styled with the same framework, allowing them to be easily dropped into any page.</li> <li>The development team consists of 5 developers and 1 tester, but we have collaborated with over 60 other developers and testers from all around the BBC to build this page.</li> </ul> <h2>What&#x2019;s next?</h2> <p>The version of the front page we&#x2019;re rolling out is an MVP, a <em>phase one</em>. We will be changing it considerably over the next several months. Here&#x2019;s an idea of what you can expect to see:</p> <a href="/introducing-a-faster-bbc-news-front-page/">(Read more)</a><p></p> </article> <article class="pb-3"> <span class="f-r c-gl">Feb 16, 2017</span> <h3> <a href="/web-development-technologies-to-adopt-in-2017/">Web development technologies to adopt in 2017</a> </h3> <p></p><p>I started 2016 feeling quite overwhelmed by the sheer number of new technologies that were being introduced. This year I feel like many of those technologies have matured, so I have collated a list of the ones that I think deserve your attention. My focus for the last couple of years has been on performance, so I&#x2019;ve made an effort to ensure that all of the technologies mentioned are either &#x201C;performance-friendly&#x201D; or are directly related to performance.</p> <h3>Preact &#x2014; <a href="https://preactjs.com/">preactjs.com</a></h3> <p>A fast 3kB alternative to React with the same ES6 API. For projects that use React&#x2019;s other APIs, <a href="https://github.com/developit/preact-compat">preact-compat</a> exists as a compatibility layer allowing Preact to be a complete drop-in replacement for React.</p> <p>As well as being smaller than React, Preact is also much faster. I measured the impact of migrating to Preact in three projects and saw a 3-4x reduction in JavaScript execution times in all of them .</p> <h3>Webpack &#x2014; <a href="https://webpack.js.org/">webpack.js.org</a></h3> <p>Bundle your scripts, images, styles, assets&#x2026; I was initially put off Webpack because I thought it did too much. With the help of <a href="https://github.com/petehunt/webpack-howto">Pete Hunt&#x2019;s webpack-howto</a> I realised that Webpack can be as simple or as complex as you want it to be.</p> <p>These days I recommend that people use Webpack even for trivial projects because it&#x2019;s easy to set up, the defaults are good, and it opens up a huge number of possibilities for optimising your application.</p> <h3>offline-plugin &#x2014; <a href="https://github.com/NekR/offline-plugin">github.com/NekR/offline-plugin</a></h3> <p>A highly-configurable Webpack plugin that provides an offline experience for your application using ServiceWorker, with AppCache as a fallback.</p> <p>If there&#x2019;s one thing on this list that you consider adopting, it should be this. The number of people around the world whose sole means of accessing the Internet on a mobile phone is <em>increasing</em>. We can improve their experience on the web immeasurably by utilising technologies like ServiceWorker &amp; AppCache, and this plugin is a ridiculously easy way to do that.</p> <h3>Tachyons &#x2014; <a href="http://tachyons.io/">tachyons.io</a></h3> <p>Functional CSS for humans. Tachyons is a mobile-first responsive CSS framework with a focus on accessibility. Its single-purpose class structure is scalable and practically removes the need to write any custom CSS.</p> <p>Tachyons has a relatively small footprint, and is extremely modular so you can easily include only what you need. It&#x2019;s a good, powerful alternative to heavier frameworks like Bootstrap or Foundation.</p> <h3>Lighthouse &#x2014; <a href="https://github.com/GoogleChrome/lighthouse">github.com/GoogleChrome/lighthouse</a></h3> <p>Built by some of the industry&#x2019;s foremost web performance evangelists, Lighthouse is an automated tool for analysing your web application&#x2019;s performance and providing insights on developer best practices.</p> <p>As well as using it as a once-in-a-while test, I also recommend running Lighthouse on a regular basis &#x2014; perhaps part of a daily build. Its insights are broad enough to cover a wide range of issues from accessibility to performance, but specific enough that any issues are easily actionable.</p> <a href="/web-development-technologies-to-adopt-in-2017/">(Read more)</a><p></p> </article> <article class="pb-3"> <span class="f-r c-gl">Jul 22, 2016</span> <h3> <a href="/redefining-the-bcc-news-core-experience/">Redefining the BBC News core experience</a> </h3> <p></p><blockquote> <p><strong>TL;DR:</strong> Over the last 4 years, the BBC News core experience has been transformed from a speedy 21KB page into a slow &amp; bloated 685KB monster. This was in part due to a lack of performance monitoring and 4 years of feature creep, but also due to a lack of performance-oriented culture throughout the business.</p> <p>I created a lightweight prototype of the BBC News core experience which demonstrates that focusing on the content first and foremost can result in an extremely fast page. I want the BBC and other websites to rethink what the core experience means, and experiment with giving users the power to define their own experience.</p> </blockquote> <p></p><p>In the beginning of 2012 the BBC Responsive News team wrote about how they provide a &#x201C;core experience&#x201D; for users by default, and then progressively enhance the page if the browser <a href="http://responsivenews.co.uk/post/18948466399/cutting-the-mustard">cuts the mustard</a>. At the time, this was cutting edge. They were able to build pages that worked on practically any browser without compromising the experience for users on modern browsers. To quote directly from the Responsive News blog:</p> <blockquote> <p>The first tier of support we call the core experience. This works on everything. I&#x2019;ve seen it work on a Nokia E65, a Blackberry OS4, Kindle 1, a HTC Touch 2 running Win Mobile 6.5, a Samsung U900 Soul, a Commodore Vic20, my nan&#x2019;s slipper and a toaster just sellotaped to a TV. Likewise, GoogleBot, text-browsers like Lynx, folks that disable JavaScript and so on are all assured a good level of service.</p> </blockquote> <p>This technique is still in use today, and is an integral part of the front-end strategy for all modern BBC News pages. In 2012 it allowed the team to provide a fast and lightweight experience for users on low-end devices. 7 HTTP requests totalling 21KB was all it took to load the core experience of the BBC News front page. All users benefited from this fast initial page load, with modern browsers progressively enhancing the rest of the page after the content was loaded.</p> <p>It has been over 4 years since the BBC News core experience was first built, and a lot has changed since then. Today, the core experience consists of 91 HTTP requests totalling 685KB &#x2013; over 32x heavier than the original core experience. With JavaScript disabled this can be reduced to 137KB &#x2013; still over 6x heavier.</p> <p>The BBC News team is aware of their website&#x2019;s shortcomings. Back in May 2015 I conducted a huge performance review which I&#x2019;ve spoken about extensively both <a href="http://slides.com/wildlyinaccurate/bbc-news-performance-review">internally</a> and <a href="http://slides.com/wildlyinaccurate/bbc-news-performance">externally</a> (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nE4LTRfcr94">video</a>). A <em>lot</em> of work has been done over the last year, and many of the issues mentioned in those slides have already been addressed. Despite this, the elephant in the room is still the core experience.</p> <p>That&#x2019;s why when BBC News ran an internal hack day (where people can form teams to work on whatever they like) I took the opportunity to totally redefine the BBC News core experience.</p> <a href="/redefining-the-bcc-news-core-experience/">(Read more)</a><p></p> </article> <article class="pb-3"> <span class="f-r c-gl">Aug 2, 2014</span> <h3> <a href="/javascript-performance-variable-initialization/">JavaScript Performance: Variable Initialization</a> </h3> <p></p><p>Initializing variables properly in JavaScript can&#xA0;have significant performance benefits.&#xA0;This can be shown with a simple synthetic benchmark.</p> <h3>notype.js</h3> <div><pre><code>var x = null;
