This can be done with SSH agent forwarding, which is <a href="http://www.unixwiz.net/techtips/ssh-agent-forwarding.html">explained in great detail on Unixwiz.net</a>.</p> <p>Setting this up is fairly straightforward. On the host machine, you need to add the following to <code>~/.ssh/config</code> (which you should create if it doesn’t exist):</p> <div><pre><code>host your.domain.com
    ForwardAgent yes
</code></pre> </div> <p>You need to replace <code>your.domain.com</code> with either the domain or the IP address of your Vagrant box. You can wildcard this with <code>host *</code>, but this is a <em>really</em> bad idea because it lets every server you SSH to access your keys.</p> <p>Once you’ve done that, just run <code>ssh-add</code> to ensure you ensure your identities are added to the SSH agent.</p> <p>Now, add the following to the config block in your Vagrantfile:</p> <div><pre><code>config.ssh.forward_agent = true
</code></pre> </div> <p>That’s all it takes. You can make sure it worked by comparing the output of <code>ssh-add -L</code> on both the host machine and the guest box.</p> <a href="/using-ssh-agent-forwarding-with-vagrant/">(Read more)</a> </article> <article class="post-summary"> <span class="post-summary__meta">Jun 9, 2013</span> <h3> <a class="post-summary__link" href="/when-did-dependency-management-get-so-complicated/">When did dependency management get so complicated?</a> </h3> <p></p><p>This evening I wanted to start hacking on a <a href="https://github.com/wildlyinaccurate/wildly-minimalistic-wordpress-theme">project of mine</a>, which is a simple WordPress theme. My main development machine was being used by somebody else, so I decided to boot up my old Sony Vaio running Ubuntu. <em>It’ll be simple</em>, I thought. <em>I’ve just got to clone the repo, run <code>npm install</code>, <code>bower install</code>, and <code>grunt build</code>, and I’ll be good to go</em>. I was wrong.</p> <p>First, the version of npm installed on the laptop is apparently so out-of-date that it can’t run the install. So I let it update itself (and all the other packages I have installed - why not?) with <code>sudo npm -g update</code>. Being a Sunday night, my broadband connection is running spectacularly slow, so the update process takes about 10 minutes at 40kB/s. But hey, at least now I can run <code>npm install</code>, right?</p> <p>Nope. Now npm is throwing some errors with unhelpful messages, but that’s fine, I’ll just trawl through the error log. 5 minutes later, I figure out that ~/tmp belongs to root (probably from running <code>npm update</code> as root). OK, fine, I’ll change the permissions and try again. This time <code>npm install</code> works! But of course, my connection is so horribly slow and grunt has so many dependencies that the install process takes <strong>over 15 minutes</strong>.</p> <a href="/when-did-dependency-management-get-so-complicated/">(Read more)</a> </article> </section> <footer class="page-footer"> <ul class="social-media"> <li> <a href="https://github.com/wildlyinaccurate"> <span class="social-media__icon"> <svg viewBox="0 0 16 16"> <path fill="#828282" d="M7.999,0.431c-4.285,0-7.76,3.474-7.76,7.761 c0,3.428,2.223,6.337,5.307,7.363c0.388,0.071,0.53-0.168,0.53-0.374c0-0.184-0.007-0.672-0.01-1.32 c-2.159,0.469-2.614-1.04-2.614-1.04c-0.353-0.896-0.862-1.135-0.862-1.135c-0.705-0.481,0.053-0.472,0.053-0.472 c0.779,0.055,1.189,0.8,1.189,0.8c0.692,1.186,1.816,0.843,2.258,0.645c0.071-0.502,0.271-0.843,0.493-1.037 C4.86,11.425,3.049,10.76,3.049,7.786c0-0.847,0.302-1.54,0.799-2.082C3.768,5.507,3.501,4.718,3.924,3.65 c0,0,0.652-0.209,2.134,0.796C6.677,4.273,7.34,4.187,8,4.184c0.659,0.003,1.323,0.089,1.943,0.261 c1.482-1.004,2.132-0.796,2.132-0.796c0.423,1.068,0.157,1.857,0.077,2.054c0.497,0.542,0.798,1.235,0.798,2.082 c0,2.981-1.814,3.637-3.543,3.829c0.279,0.24,0.527,0.713,0.527,1.437c0,1.037-0.01,1.874-0.01,2.129 c0,0.208,0.14,0.449,0.534,0.373c3.081-1.028,5.302-3.935,5.302-7.362C15.76,3.906,12.285,0.431,7.999,0.431z"/> </svg> </span> <span class="username">wildlyinaccurate</span> </a> </li> <li> <a href="https://twitter.com/Joseph_Wynn"> <span class="social-media__icon"> <svg viewBox="0 0 16 16"> <path fill="#828282" d="M15.969,3.058c-0.586,0.26-1.217,0.436-1.878,0.515c0.675-0.405,1.194-1.045,1.438-1.809
