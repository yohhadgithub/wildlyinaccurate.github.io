This can be pretty annoying if you’re planning on using another web server (or no web server at all).</p> <p>If you take a look at the package dependencies (<a href="http://packages.debian.org/wheezy/php5">Debian</a>/<a href="http://packages.ubuntu.com/quantal/php5">Ubuntu</a>) you’ll see why this happens - <code>php5</code> needs one of either <code>libapache2-mod-php5</code>, <code>libapache2-mod-php5filter</code>, <code>php5-cgi</code>, or <code>php5-fpm</code>. APT doesn’t care which package it installs; it just picks the first package that satisfies the dependency, which is why you get the <code>apache2</code> packages.</p> <p>You can get around this by installing one of the other dependencies <em>before</em> <code>php5</code>. For example, <code>apt-get install php5-fpm php5</code> or <code>apt-get install php5-cgi php5</code>.</p> <a href="/installing-php-on-debian-without-apache/">(Read more)</a> </article> <article class="post-summary"> <span class="post-summary__meta">Aug 1, 2013</span> <h3> <a class="post-summary__link" href="/using-ssh-agent-forwarding-with-vagrant/">Using SSH agent forwarding with Vagrant</a> </h3> <p></p><p>Sometimes you’ll want to use your local SSH keys on your Vagrant boxes, so that you don’t have to manage password-less keys for each box. This can be done with SSH agent forwarding, which is <a href="http://www.unixwiz.net/techtips/ssh-agent-forwarding.html">explained in great detail on Unixwiz.net</a>.</p> <p>Setting this up is fairly straightforward. On the host machine, you need to add the following to <code>~/.ssh/config</code> (which you should create if it doesn’t exist):</p> <div><pre><code>host your.domain.com
    ForwardAgent yes
</code></pre></div> <p>You need to replace <code>your.domain.com</code> with either the domain or the IP address of your Vagrant box. You can wildcard this with <code>host *</code>, but this is a <em>really</em> bad idea because it lets every server you SSH to access your keys.</p> <p>Once you’ve done that, just run <code>ssh-add</code> to ensure you ensure your identities are added to the SSH agent.</p> <p>Now, add the following to the config block in your Vagrantfile:</p> <div><pre><code>config.ssh.forward_agent = true</code></pre></div> <p>That’s all it takes. You can make sure it worked by comparing the output of <code>ssh-add -L</code> on both the host machine and the guest box.</p> <a href="/using-ssh-agent-forwarding-with-vagrant/">(Read more)</a> </article> <article class="post-summary"> <span class="post-summary__meta">Jul 17, 2013</span> <h3> <a class="post-summary__link" href="/worst-fonts-for-programming/">Worst fonts for programming</a> </h3> <p></p><p>There are <a href="http://www.slant.co/topics/67/~what-are-the-best-programming-fonts">plenty</a> <a href="http://hivelogic.com/articles/top-10-programming-fonts">of</a> <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1058946">discussions</a> about which font is the best for programming.

My main development machine was being used by somebody else, so I decided to boot up my old Sony Vaio running Ubuntu. <em>It’ll be simple</em>, I thought. <em>I’ve just got to clone the repo, run <code>npm install</code>, <code>bower install</code>, and <code>grunt build</code>, and I’ll be good to go</em>. I was wrong.</p> <p>First, the version of npm installed on the laptop is apparently so out-of-date that it can’t run the install. So I let it update itself (and all the other packages I have installed - why not?) with <code>sudo npm -g update</code>. Being a Sunday night, my broadband connection is running spectacularly slow, so the update process takes about 10 minutes at 40kB/s. But hey, at least now I can run <code>npm install</code>, right?</p> <p>Nope. Now npm is throwing some errors with unhelpful messages, but that’s fine, I’ll just trawl through the error log. 5 minutes later, I figure out that ~/tmp belongs to root (probably from running <code>npm update</code> as root). Ok, fine, I’ll change the permissions and try again. This time <code>npm install</code> works! But of course, my connection is so horribly slow and grunt has so many dependencies that the install process takes <strong>over 15 minutes</strong>.</p> <a href="/when-did-dependency-management-get-so-complicated/">(Read more)</a> </article> <article class="post-summary"> <span class="post-summary__meta">May 20, 2013</span> <h3> <a class="post-summary__link" href="/blazing-fast-wordpress-with-nginx-and-memcached/">Blazing fast WordPress with Nginx and Memcached</a> </h3> <p></p><p>Inspired by Eric Mann’s post on <a href="http://eamann.com/tech/ludicrous-speed-wordpress-caching-with-redis/">caching WordPress with Redis</a>, I thought I’d experiment with a similar setup using Memcached. Any in-memory caching system should work just as well, but I’ve chosen Memcached because it’s already running on my server and because PHP already has a <a href="http://www.php.net/manual/en/class.memcached.php">built-in libmemcached API</a>.</p> <p>My current setup is Nginx and PHP-FPM, with WP Super Cache. The cache is saved to the filesystem, allowing Nginx to serve static files (which it is <a href="http://nbonvin.wordpress.com/2011/03/14/apache-vs-nginx-vs-varnish-vs-gwan/">very good at</a>) without needing to pass any requests to PHP. This setup has worked very well, so I’ll be using it as a baseline.</p> <p>To use Memcached, every request needs to be passed to PHP. My gut feeling was that this would be slower than serving static files with Nginx due to the overhead of spinning up a PHP process for each request.</p> <h2>Benchmarks</h2> <p>To find out which of the two setups was faster, I measured the following metrics using <a href="http://www.webpagetest.org/">WebPagetest</a> and <a href="http://www.blitz.io/bhm0Fw2xDFNoGcFXNKJaQSu">Blitz</a> :</p> <ul> <li>Time To First Byte (although CloudFlare has speculated that <a href="http://blog.cloudflare.com/ttfb-time-to-first-byte-considered-meaningles">TTFB is a meaningless metric</a>)</li> <li>Average response time</li> <li>Average hit rate</li> </ul> <a href="/blazing-fast-wordpress-with-nginx-and-memcached/">(Read more)</a> </article> <article class="post-summary"> <span class="post-summary__meta">May 20, 2013</span> <h3> <a class="post-summary__link" href="/increasing-the-size-of-the-lish-console/">Increasing the size of the LISH console</a> </h3> <p></p><p>If you’ve used Linode’s LISH console to get remote access to your server, you’re probably familiar with the way the console wraps everything to 60x20 (columns x rows) - even when you’re connected via ssh in a much larger terminal.</p> <a href="/increasing-the-size-of-the-lish-console/">(Read more)</a> </article> <article class="post-summary"> <span class="post-summary__meta">Mar 16, 2013</span> <h3> <a class="post-summary__link" href="/stop-posting-jobs-for-hackers/">Stop posting jobs for "hackers"</a> </h3> <p></p><p>I understand what people mean when they say that they want to hire a <em>hacker</em>.

This can happen when the php5-fpm package reconfigures itself to listen on a different socket. Here’s how you can solve it.</p> <p>Check to make sure that php-fpm is running with <code>ps aux | grep php</code> - if you can’t see any php-fpm processes in the output, then you may need to re-install php-fpm. If php-fpm is running okay, then skip this first step.</p> <div><pre><code>sudo apt-get remove php5 php5-cgi php5-fpm
sudo apt-get install php5 php5-cgi php5-fpm
</code></pre></div> <p>The thing to notice here is that the order in which you install the packages is important. In the past I have found that installing them in the wrong order causes the packages to be configured incorrectly.</p> <p>Next, get php-fpm to listen on the correct host/port. In <code>/etc/php5/fpm/pool.d/www.conf</code> change the <code>listen</code> value to match the <code>fastcgi_pass</code> location in your Nginx configuration. For example, I changed mine from:</p> <div><pre><code>listen = /var/run/php5-fpm.sock
</code></pre></div> <p>To:</p> <div><pre><code>listen = 127.0.0.1:9000
</code></pre></div> <p>If you are configuring php-fpm to listen on a Unix socket, you should also check that the socket file has the correct owner and permissions. While I wouldn’t recommend it, you can simply give read-write permissions to all with <code>sudo chmod go+rw /var/run/php5-fpm.sock</code>.</p> <p>Restart php-fpm with <code>sudo service php5-fpm restart</code> and everything should work normally again.</p> <a href="/solving-502-bad-gateway-with-nginx-php-fpm/">(Read more)</a> </article> <article class="post-summary"> <span class="post-summary__meta">Sep 12, 2012</span> <h3> <a class="post-summary__link" href="/sublime-text-packages-for-web-development/">Sublime Text packages for web development</a> </h3> <p></p><p>Coming from <a href="http://www.jetbrains.com/phpstorm/">PhpStorm</a> (a full-featured IDE), I felt that Sublime Text was missing a few useful features.

I scrambled out of bed and hid in a doorway until the shaking stopped. After checking that my family was okay, I went upstairs and stepped onto the balcony to look out over Christchurch.
