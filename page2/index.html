            </h3>

            <p><p>Inspired by Eric Mann’s post on <a href="http://eamann.com/tech/ludicrous-speed-wordpress-caching-with-redis/">caching WordPress with Redis</a>, I thought I’d experiment with a similar setup using Memcached. Any in-memory caching system should work just as well, but I’ve chosen Memcached because it’s already running on my server and because PHP already has a <a href="http://www.php.net/manual/en/class.memcached.php">built-in libmemcached API</a>.</p>

<p>My current setup is Nginx and PHP-FPM, with WP Super Cache. The cache is saved to the filesystem, allowing Nginx to serve static files (which it is <a href="http://nbonvin.wordpress.com/2011/03/14/apache-vs-nginx-vs-varnish-vs-gwan/">very good at</a>) without needing to pass any requests to PHP. This setup has worked very well, so I’ll be using it as a baseline.</p>

<p>To use Memcached, every request needs to be passed to PHP. My gut feeling was that this would be slower than serving static files with Nginx due to the overhead of spinning up a PHP process for each request.</p>

<h2>Benchmarks</h2>

<p>To find out which of the two setups was faster, I measured the following metrics using <a href="http://www.webpagetest.org/">WebPagetest</a> and <a href="http://www.blitz.io/bhm0Fw2xDFNoGcFXNKJaQSu">Blitz</a> :</p>

<ul>
  <li>Time To First Byte (although CloudFlare has speculated that <a href="http://blog.cloudflare.com/ttfb-time-to-first-byte-considered-meaningles">TTFB is a meaningless metric</a>)</li>
  <li>Average response time</li>
  <li>Average hit rate</li>

  <li>Trim trailing whitespace - <code>"trim_trailing_white_space_on_save": true</code></li>
  <li>Always use Unix line endings (LF) - <code>"default_line_ending": "unix"</code></li>
  <li>Ensure files end with a new line - <code>"ensure_newline_at_eof_on_save": true</code></li>
  <li>Automatically detect indentation style - <code>"detect_indentation": true</code></li>

            </h3>

            <p><p>After upgrading php-fpm, my PHP-based sites were returning “502 Bad Gateway” errors. This can happen when the php5-fpm package reconfigures itself to listen on a different socket. Here’s how you can solve it.</p>

<p>Check to make sure that php-fpm is running with <code>ps aux | grep php</code> - if you can’t see any php-fpm processes in the output, then you may need to re-install php-fpm. If php-fpm is running okay, then skip this first step.</p>

<div><pre><code>sudo apt-get remove php5 php5-cgi php5-fpm
sudo apt-get install php5 php5-cgi php5-fpm
</code></pre></div>

<p>The thing to notice here is that the order in which you install the packages is important. In the past I have found that installing them in the wrong order causes the packages to be configured incorrectly.</p>

<p>Next, get php-fpm to listen on the correct host/port. In <code>/etc/php5/fpm/pool.d/www.conf</code> change the <code>listen</code> value to match the <code>fastcgi_pass</code> location in your Nginx configuration. For example, I changed mine from:</p>

<div><pre><code>listen = /var/run/php5-fpm.sock
</code></pre></div>

<p>To:</p>

<div><pre><code>listen = 127.0.0.1:9000
</code></pre></div>

<p>If you are configuring php-fpm to listen on a Unix socket, you should also check that the socket file has the correct owner and permissions. While I wouldn’t recommend it, you can simply give read-write permissions to all with <code>sudo chmod go+rw /var/run/php5-fpm.sock</code>.</p>

<p>Restart php-fpm with <code>sudo service php5-fpm restart</code> and everything should work normally again.</p>

            <p><p>In the early hours of 4 September 2010, I was sound asleep in my house on Mount Pleasant hill in Christchurch, New Zealand. At 4:35am I was woken by a deep rumbling sound. Seconds later, the floor and walls began to shake as my house was rocked back and forth on its foundations. I scrambled out of bed and hid in a doorway until the shaking stopped. After checking that my family was okay, I went upstairs and stepped onto the balcony to look out over Christchurch. The city was silent save for a few car alarms, and it was in this relative quiet that I came to understand the significance of this event. I didn’t realise it then, but that earthquake would become a catalyst for change in my life.</p>

            <p><p>There are a two main things that tripped me up while I was writing functional tests for my Laravel controllers: POST requests, and session state.</p>

<p>Laravel’s Controller class has the <code>call()</code> method, which essentially makes a GET request to a controller method. In order to make POST requests, it’s necessary to inject some extra parameters into the <code>HttpFoundation</code> components. To make this easier, I created a <code>ControllerTestCase</code> class with convenient <code>get()</code> and <code>post()</code> methods:</p>

                <a class="post-summary__link" href="/bcrypt-choosing-a-work-factor/">Bcrypt: Choosing a Work Factor</a>
            </h3>

            <p><p>Bcrypt is a Blowfish-based hashing algorithm which is commonly used for password hashing because of its potentially expensive key setup phase. A Bcrypt hash has the following structure:</p>

<div><pre><code>$2a$(2 chars work)$(22 chars salt)(31 chars hash)
</code></pre></div>

<p>The reason that the key setup phase can be potentially expensive is because it is run <code>2</code> times. As password hashing is usually associated with common tasks like logging a user into a system, it’s important to find the right balance between security and performance. Using a high work factor makes it incredibly difficult to execute a brute-force attack, but can put unnecessary load on the system.</p>

<p>Using <a href="https://gist.github.com/1053158/">Marco Arment’s PHP Bcrypt class</a>, I performed some benchmarks to determine how long it takes to hash a string with various work factors:</p>

            <p><p>It’s really easy to set up automatic MySQL backups using <code>mysqldump</code>. First, you need to set up a user with <code>SELECT</code> and <code>LOCK TABLES</code> privileges. In this example the user doesn’t have a password.</p>

<div><pre><code>CREATE USER 'autobackup'@'localhost';
GRANT SELECT, LOCK TABLES ON *.* TO 'autobackup'@'localhost';</code></pre></div>

<p>Next create the cron job with <code>crontab -e</code>. This job is set to run every day at 5:20am.</p>

<div><pre><code>20 5 * * * mysqldump --user=autobackup **dbname** | gzip -c &gt; /var/backups/**dbname**-`/bin/date +\%Y\%m\%d`.sql.gz
</code></pre></div>

<p>Don’t forget to change <strong>dbname</strong> to the name of the database that you want to backup. And that’s it - you’re done! This cron job will create a backup of your database and save it to <code>/var/backups</code> with a filename based on the current date, e.g. <code>/var/backups/**dbname**-20120503.sql.gz</code></p>

            </h3>

            <p><p>MySQL has a <a href="http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.1/en/create-index.html">prefix limitation</a> of 767 bytes in InnoDB, and 1000 bytes in MyISAM. This has never been a problem for me, until I started using UTF-16 as the character set for one of my databases. UTF-16 can use up to 4 bytes per character which means that in an InnoDB table, you can’t have any keys longer than 191 characters. Take this <code>CREATE</code> statement for example:</p>

<div><pre><code>CREATE TABLE `user` (
  `id` int(11) NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
  `username` varchar(32) NOT NULL,
  `password` varchar(64) NOT NULL,
  `email` varchar(255) NOT NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY (`id`),
  UNIQUE KEY `UNIQ_8D93D649F85E0677` (`username`),
  UNIQUE KEY `UNIQ_8D93D649E7927C74` (`email`)
) ENGINE=InnoDB DEFAULT CHARSET=utf16 AUTO_INCREMENT=1 ;</code></pre></div>

<p>This will fail with an error like <code>Specified key was too long; max key length is 767 bytes</code>, because the <code>UNIQUE INDEX</code> on the email field requires at least 1020 bytes (255 * 4).</p>

<p>Unfortunately there is no real solution to this. Your only options are to either reduce the size of the column, use a different character set (like UTF-8), or use a different engine (like MyISAM). In this case I switched the character set to UTF-8 which raised the maximum key length to 255 characters.</p>
