The soft Cherry MX Brown switches make it my favourites for long periods of typing. Even so, I rarely use it anymore. At the time of writing, this model is still available <a href="http://www.daskeyboard.com/model-s-ultimate/">on the Das Keyboard website</a>.</p> <div> <div> Das Keyboard Model S Ultimate </div> </div> <h3>CODE Keyboard</h3> <p>I was really excited when Jeff Atwood <a href="http://blog.codinghorror.com/the-code-keyboard/">announced the CODE keyboard</a>. I already knew that I wanted my next keyboard to be compact and have backlit keys, so the CODE seemed to come at just the right time. Not long after buying the CODE, I purchased some <a href="https://www.massdrop.com/buy/keycool-rainbow-keycaps?mode=guest_open">Keycool rainbow keycaps</a> so brighten things up.</p> <p>The CODE has Cherry MX Clear switches, which makes for a much firmer keyboard than the Das. I find the clears preferable for short bursts of typing, but over long periods they tire my hands out.</p> <div> <div> CODE keyboard with Keycool rainbow keycaps </div> </div> <h3>ErgoDox</h3> <p>As I’ve mentioned in <a href="/transitioning-to-a-new-keyboard-layout/">a previous post</a>, I decided that I wanted a split-hand keyboard. After much searching, I settled on buying an ErgoDox kit <a href="https://www.massdrop.com/buy/ergodox?mode=guest_open">from Massdrop</a>. This was a really fun project and involved spending plenty of time at the London Hackspace soldering station. The ErgoDox is by far the most comfortable keyboard I’ve used – I like it so much I’ve even placed an order for <a href="https://www.massdrop.com/buy/infinity-ergodox?mode=guest_open">the next generation ErgoDox</a>.</p> <p>My ErgoDox has Cherry MX Clear switches. Somehow the clears on the ErgoDox feel much softer than on the CODE, so I’m able to enjoy the feeling of firm keys without the fatigue I experience with the CODE.</p> <div> <div> ErgoDox keyboard </div> </div> <a href="/accidental-keyboard-enthusiasm/">(Read more)</a> </article> <article class="post-summary"> <span class="post-summary__meta">Oct 31, 2014</span> <h3> <a class="post-summary__link" href="/transitioning-to-a-new-keyboard-layout/">Transitioning to a new keyboard layout</a> </h3> <p></p><p>I’ve long been considering switching to a different keyboard layout. I tend to type with mostly my forefinger and middle finger, only using my ring and pinky fingers occasionally to stretch out to the modifier keys. Despite this, I still manage to type at around 120WPM on a staggered QWERTY keyboard.</p> <p>Thinking back, I probably started teaching myself to type at a reasonable speed around age 10. I’m now in my mid-twenties. My typing technique (or lack thereof) never really bothered me, but 15 years of typing with poor technique has started to take its toll. Recently I’ve started experiencing hand fatigue, and I’m beginning to see early signs of RSI. So I figure now is the perfect time to make some changes to the way I type.</p> <a href="/transitioning-to-a-new-keyboard-layout/">(Read more)</a> </article> </section> <footer class="page-footer"> <ul class="social-media"> <li> <a href="https://github.com/wildlyinaccurate"> <span class="social-media__icon"> <svg viewBox="0 0 16 16"> <path fill="#828282" d="M7.999,0.431c-4.285,0-7.76,3.474-7.76,7.761 c0,3.428,2.223,6.337,5.307,7.363c0.388,0.071,0.53-0.168,0.53-0.374c0-0.184-0.007-0.672-0.01-1.32 c-2.159,0.469-2.614-1.04-2.614-1.04c-0.353-0.896-0.862-1.135-0.862-1.135c-0.705-0.481,0.053-0.472,0.053-0.472 c0.779,0.055,1.189,0.8,1.189,0.8c0.692,1.186,1.816,0.843,2.258,0.645c0.071-0.502,0.271-0.843,0.493-1.037 C4.86,11.425,3.049,10.76,3.049,7.786c0-0.847,0.302-1.54,0.799-2.082C3.768,5.507,3.501,4.718,3.924,3.65 c0,0,0.652-0.209,2.134,0.796C6.677,4.273,7.34,4.187,8,4.184c0.659,0.003,1.323,0.089,1.943,0.261 c1.482-1.004,2.132-0.796,2.132-0.796c0.423,1.068,0.157,1.857,0.077,2.054c0.497,0.542,0.798,1.235,0.798,2.082 c0,2.981-1.814,3.637-3.543,3.829c0.279,0.24,0.527,0.713,0.527,1.437c0,1.037-0.01,1.874-0.01,2.129 c0,0.208,0.14,0.449,0.534,0.373c3.081-1.028,5.302-3.935,5.302-7.362C15.76,3.906,12.285,0.431,7.999,0.431z"/> </svg> </span> <span class="username">wildlyinaccurate</span> </a> </li> <li> <a href="https://twitter.com/Joseph_Wynn"> <span class="social-media__icon"> <svg viewBox="0 0 16 16"> <path fill="#828282" d="M15.969,3.058c-0.586,0.26-1.217,0.436-1.878,0.515c0.675-0.405,1.194-1.045,1.438-1.809
